Japanese.  In 2006, I started working at \nGoldman Sachs (\u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d) in Tokyo, Japan. While at Goldman Sachs, I worked in \nvarious departments including Derivatives, Prime Brokerage, Foreign Exchange, Treasury, \nand Equity Derivatives operations. I was promoted to Senior Vice President in the Operations \ndivision in 2012. My area of focus at Goldman Sachs included cash management, \nreconciliations, payment controls, treasury management, and financial reporting. \n7. \nI was employed at Goldman Sachs for 11 years (from 2006 to 2017) working \nin the Tokyo, New York, Moscow, and Salt Lake City offices during this period.  My interest \nin cryptocurrency began in 2014 when I first experimented with acquiring Bitcoin and \nsending it to a friend.  I subsequently attended Bitcoin conferences where I deepened my \nunderstanding of the underlying blockchain technology.  While at Goldman Sachs in 2015, I \nwrote a presentation comparing Bitcoin, gold, and fiat and circulated it to colleagues and \ncertain Managing Directors. In 2016 I completed an online course on cryptography.  I was \ninvited to join Quoine Corporation (\u201cQuoine\u201d) as Head of Operations in Tokyo in September \n2017 and decided to focus my professional life on developing a cryptocurrency exchange \nbusiness.  I was later promoted to Chief Operating Officer of Liquid in November 2019. \nBACKGROUND ON LIQUID \n8. \nLiquid Group, Inc. (\u201cLiquid\u201d or \u201cLGI\u201d) was a holding company that owned \n(among other non-operating entities) two successful cryptocurrency exchange operating \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 3 of 26\n\n \n4 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \nentities with difficult-to-obtain licenses: Quoine and Quoine Pte. Ltd. in Singapore (\u201cQuoine \nSingapore\u201d).   I started acquiring shares in Liquid on October 1, 2019 when I purchased \n2,430 shares.  I purchased an additional 1,350 shares of Liquid on December 31,  2020 and \nfinally another purchase of 6,366 shares on February 8, 2021.   \n9. \nDating back to its founding in 2014,  Quoine provided various cryptocurrency \nexchange services, including crypto derivatives trading, to Japanese residents.  Starting from \n2018 shortly after I joined, Quoine operated with a strict process for segregating customer \nfunds for both fiat and cryptocurrencies. This asset segregation process was audited both \ninternally and by external auditors, under detailed written procedures for daily monitoring.  \nAs COO of  Quoine, it was my responsibility to ensure that customers\u2019 fiat assets were stored \nin a Trust company account and each customer's crypto assets were stored in segregated, cold \nwallets.  In Japan, cold wallets are defined as wallets where the Private Key that controls the \nwallet address is never connected to the internet. I supervised a daily reconciliation process to \nensure the asset balances held at the Trust account and cold wallets were either equal to or \nexceeded the aggregated customer balances.4 \n10. \nShortly after I began my employment at Quoine, the company received a \nlicense for the exchange of cryptocurrencies under the Japanese Payment Services Act \n(\u201cPSA\u201d).   The PSA license was an important step for the company to serve Japan residents \nin a legal, compliant manner.  The PSA license also facilitated the company's work with local \nbanks in Japan to handle customer fiat deposits and withdrawals. \n11. \nIn 2020, Quoine applied to Japan Financial Services Agency (\u201cJFSA\u201d) for  a \nType 1 Financial Instruments Business License.  This license is required for a business that \nengages in the trading in capital-market products, including securities, stocks, bonds, and \n \n4 Post-acquisition of LGI by FTX, the asset segregation process at FTX Japan KK (previously Quoine) \ncontinued largely unchanged in both procedure and personnel.   \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 4 of 26\n\n \n5 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \nderivatives.  The JFSA regulates this Type I license under the Financial Instruments and \nExchange Act.  The license was important to the company in order to continue to offer a \ncrypto exchange platform for Customers who wanted to trade in crypto derivatives.  \nHistorically crypto derivatives made up a majority of the revenue and trade volumes for the \ncompany. \n12. \nAfter nearly two years of effort by myself and others, Quoine was granted the \nType 1 license on October 31, 2021.  Among other requirements, as a cryptocurrency \nexchange licensed under the JFSA, Quoine was required to maintain asset segregation and \nperform a daily reconciliation of its own assets with customer obligations.   \n13. \nThe value of this license can not be overstated.  Less than six (6) crypto-\nrelated businesses in Japan have been granted a Type 1 license for offering services for \ncrypto derivatives trading and no crypto-related Type 1 licenses have been issued since \nQuoine received its license.  In the 2018-2021 time frame, the JFSA began imposing \nsanctions on non-licensed entities offering exchange services to Japanese residents.  Binance \nhad received two such sanctions in 2018 and 2021.5  I and others in the company were \nworking on obtaining the Type 1 license throughout 2020 and 2021.  By the spring of 2021, \nwe had certain indications the Type 1 license process was on track for approval by late \nsummer or early fall of 2021.   \n14. \nQuoine Singapore operated under an exemption to the Singapore Payment \nServices Act for the exchange of digital payment tokens.  While under the exemption, Quoine \nSingapore was regulated by the Monetary Authority in Singapore (MAS). \n15. \nFor the full year ending in 2021, Liquid monthly revenue (from its subsidiaries \nQuoine (Japan) and Quine Singapore) averaged $2,400,000 per month.  Liquid also reached \n \n5 See \u201cJapan's Financial Services Regulator Issues Binance Warning\u201d available at \nhttps://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/25/japans-financial-services-regulator-issues-binance-warning/  \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 5 of 26\n\n \n6 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \nprofitability in 2021 while growing its active users and reducing its operating expenses \ncompared to 2020. The balance sheet of Liquid strengthened with net assets over $40,000,000 \nby June of 2021. \n16. \nIn summary, the businesses operated by Liquid were extremely valuable \nbecause they were profitable and had the necessary licenses that allowed them to operate \ncryptocurrency exchange businesses in two important regions in Asia. \nSUITORS; OVERTURES TO ACQUIRE LIQUID \n17. \nBeginning in the spring of 2021 and extending into the summer, I had \ndiscussions with several well-known derivative cryptocurrency exchanges and investment \nfunds about potentially investing in Liquid.   The exchanges I met with included BitMex, \nDeribit, and FTX.   The catalyst for their interest was the growing indications that FTX Japan \nwas going to receive the Type 1 license authorizing crypto derivatives trading services.  The \nType 1 license presented opportunities for non-licensed entities offering these services in the \nJapanese market to become compliant with JFSA regulations.  A collaboration between \nLiquid and these operators would allow them relatively fast and legally compliant access to \nthese two key markets in which Liquid already had licensing in place, in particular in Japan \nwith the Type 1 license for crypto derivatives.  \n18. \nIn early 2021, Liquid began engaging with investors and investment banks in \nraising capital.  Different options were considered including public listing and SPAC \ntransactions.  By April of 2021, the company received indicative valuations from the \ninvestment banks Nomura (Exhibit 1) and Deutsche Bank (Exhibit 2) with valuations of \nLiquid ranging from $600,000,000 to $1,000,000,000.  In 2021 crypto markets saw increased \ninterest including a rise in market value of crypto assets.  Along with this there was a rise in \ninvestor interest in the companies in the industry.  In April of 2021, Coinbase went public \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 6 of 26\n\n \n7 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \nwith a valuation of $86,000,0000,000. In general, there was a considerable amount of capital \nraising being done by crypto currency exchanges. \n19. \nBy September 2021, several cryptocurrency exchanges, including rivals to \nFTX such as Binance and ByBit, were publicly sanctioned by the JFSA for providing crypto \ncurrency exchange services without registering with the JFSA. I was told by FTX executives \nSam Bankman Fried and Can Sun that the Japanese market was one of FTX\u2019s top markets \nglobally for trade revenues and volumes.  I learned from FTX Executives that in  the month \nof October 2021, FTX derived over $2,000,000 in revenue from Japanese users of the FTX \nexchange despite FTX not being registered with the JFSA.  This was 6 times higher than in \nthe year earlier period.   \n20. \nIn August 2021, Quoine suffered a breach of some of its hot wallets, which the \nUS FBI later, upon investigation, attributed to North Korean state actors.  To repair this \nbreach, Liquid borrowed $120,000,000 from FTX under a Loan Agreement (LA) which was \nexecuted on August 30, 2021. \nFTX\u2019S ACQUISITION OF LIQUID \n21. \nOn Sept 2, 2021, a nonbinding term sheet \u201cMOU for acquisition of LGI\u201d \n(Exhibit 3) was executed to sell Liquid to FTX.  On October 12, 2021, an amendment to the \nMOU was executed (Exhibit 4).  Shareholders of Liquid agreed to sell their interests to FTX \nfor a lower price due to the certainty and timing of a transaction with FTX.  At that point in \ntime FTX had a stellar reputation and appeared to have sufficient resources to make the deal \nhappen in a short period of time.  Going public or pursuing a SPAC was seen as taking longer \nwhich was less attractive for the Venture Capital investors such as JAFCo which were \napproaching their mandated time of 5 years to exit from their investment in Liquid.   For \nmyself, I saw FTX as a fast growing, innovative business that according to its public facing \nrepresentations had a company focus on compliance to protect customers.  FTX\u2019s assurances \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 7 of 26\n\n \n8 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \nof its compliance and innovation were important factors for me in thinking of FTX as a place \naligned with my own values where I could continue to develop my career.  After Quoine had \nbeen issued its JFSA Type 1 license on October 31, 2021, negotiations over the details of an \nFTX acquisition of Liquid commenced.  The values of Liquid stock are reflected on pages \n36-37 of the SPA (hereinfafter defined), which valued all the shares of Liquid at \n$200,000,0006     \n22. \nAcquiring shares of Liquid for its licenses and existing user base was \nnecessary to allow FTX to continue to grow its business in a compliant and sustainable \nmanner. FTX\u2019s acquisition of  Liquid shares to obtain the Type 1 license was a prelude to \nobtaining licenses in other regulated, regional markets around the world.  FTX used its \nacquisition of licenses including those of FTX Japan as a key point in its materials provided \nto equity investors during the Series C funding round which was completed in January 2022. \n(Exhibit 27).  This Series C funding presentation was made to prospective investors in \nDecember 2021, in which  FTX prominently featured its pending acquisition of FTX Japan \nwith its focus on compliance and regulation.  In January 2022, FTX was able to raise \nadditional capital by selling FTX common shares to investors in a Series C funding round \nvaluing the company at $32,000,000,000.  This valuation was significantly higher than the B-\n1 funding only a few months earlier in late 2021, which had valued FTX  at $17,900,000,000. \n(Exhibit 13). \n23. \nOn November 19, 2021, I signed the Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of \nShares, Stock Options, and Warrants in Liquid Group Inc. (Major Shareholders) (Exhibit 14) \nas modified by that certain Side Letter Agreement between myself and FTX of the same date \n \n6 It should be noted that $147,203,152 of the $200 million paid to the shareholders of Liquid, consisted of cash \nand cryptocurrency, representing ~74% of the value of the Liquid securities sold to FTX.   The FTX \n\u201cconsideration shares\u201d were incidental to the overall transaction because they represented 26% of the \n$200,000,000 total value of Liquid shares sold to FTX. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 8 of 26\n\n \n9 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \n(the \u201cNovember 19th Side Letter\u201d; collectively, the \u201cSPA\u201d) (Exhibit 10).  The November \n19th Side Letter provides in relevant part that:  \nThe total amount of consideration to be paid by the Purchaser to Mr. Melamed (the \n\u201cConsideration\u201d) shall be paid ratably on the Completion Date, the Second \nCompletion Date and the Last Completion Date, provided, that the total amount of \nCrypto Consideration of Mr. Melamed, which shall be withheld in its entirety by the \nPurchaser as Retained Consideration in accordance with clause 4 of the Major \nShareholders SPA, shall be paid on the Completion Date. \n \n24. \n  Through the SPA, I conveyed 12,203 common shares and 510 stock options \nof Liquid to FTX.   \n25. \nThe SPA was executed under Japanese law with any disputes to be resolved \nby binding arbitration, administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) \n19.2, SPA.  Section 19.1 of the SPA provides that: \u201c[t]his Agreement (including a dispute \nrelating to its existence, validity or termination) and any non-contractual obligation or other \nmatter arising out of or in connection with it are governed by the laws of Japan.\u201d   \n26. \nThe \u201cCompletion\u201d or closing date of the SPA was subject to certain closing \nconditions on both the Purchaser (FTX) and Seller (Liquid).  Closing conditions were \ncompleted on April 4, 2022, which became the \u201cCompletion\u201d date.  On the April 4, 2022, \nCompletion date, all of my Liquid shares and options were transferred and registered to FTX.  \nIn exchange, FTX agreed to pay me consideration worth a total of $44,516,390.24, consisting \nof: \n\u25cf 1,019,070 shares of FTX common stock valued for purposes of the SPA at \n$26,709,834.14 (the \u201cFTX Consideration Shares\u201d); \n\u25cf $8,903,278.05 in cash (the \u201cCash Payment\u201d), and \n\u25cf $8,903,278.05 worth of cryptocurrency (the \u201cRetained Consideration\u201d). \n \n27. \nThe Retained Consideration consisted of four types of cryptocurrencies, in \nkind: 39.132 BTC, 560.48 ETH, 11,844.98 SOL, and 47,532 FTT.  SPA, Schedule 2, item 4 \nat p. 37. The Retained Consideration was to be transferred to me on the April 4, 2022, \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 9 of 26\n\n \n10 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \nCompletion Date. The Retained Consideration was paid to me but was to be held as security \nagainst my share of any indemnification obligations under the SPA.  \n28. \nSection 2.4 of the SPA described the manner in which the Retained \nConsideration would be held by FTX: \nAt Completion, the Purchaser shall withhold (a) the remainder of the Cash \nConsideration, being the amount of USD 12,458,902.44 (the \u201cRetained Cash \nConsideration\u201d) and (b) the Crypto Consideration, in a manner to be agreed in good \nfaith by the Purchaser and the Management Shareholders. \n \n \n29. \nPrior to the April 4, 2022 Completion Date, I requested FTX on numerous \noccasions to hold the Retained Consideration in segregated wallets.  Sam Bankman-Fried and \nother FTX management Can Sun and Nishad Singh executives repeatedly and falsely assured \nme that my Retained Consideration would be segregated from FTX\u2019s own assets, breaching \nFTX\u2019s warranties found in 7.2, SPA.   \n30. \nAs a condition of FTX\u2019s acquisition of the Liquid Shares, I was required to \nsign a Management Agreement (Exhibit 6) which was amended on 30 June 2022 (Exhibit 7 ) \nand then again on 19 October 2022 (Exhibit 8)  (as amended, the \u201cManagement \nAgreement\u201d)  under which I was appointed Representative Director (RD) and Chief \nOperating Officer (COO) of FTX Japan KK, the operating subsidiary of the Liquid holding \ncompany,  renamed FTX Japan Holdings KK (Holdings). The Management Agreement \nspecified my roles and responsibilities as COO, which included wallet management, new \nproduct development,  integration of existing products into the FTX ecosystem, and business \ndevelopment. I was required to sign a second Side Letter Agreement dated 31 March 2022. \n(Exhibit 9) which is governed by the laws of Japan and requires arbitration of any disputes \nunder SIAC. The Management Agreement is governed by the \u201claws of Japan and the Tokyo \nDistrict Court shall be the court of first instance having the exclusive jurisdiction over any \ndispute that may arise out of or in relation to this Agreement.\u201d Para.16. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 10 of 26\n\n \n11 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \n31. \nUnder Japanese law, my understanding is a Representative Director is a type \nof Director with the company's highest authority with the right to enter into business and sign \nlegal contracts on behalf of the corporation in Japan. As the highest-ranking executive, the \nRepresentative Director carries significant legal responsibilities and potential personal \nliability for the company\u2019s violations of law and financial injury to customers. \n \n32. As per the Management Agreement, I served as COO and Representative Director of \nFTX Japan until July 26, 2024, when I resigned concurrently with the sale of FTX \nJapan to Bitflyer Holdings. (Exhibit 25). Following this sale, the chapter 11 case of \nFTX Japan was dismissed,  [D.I. 20560].  \n33. \nOn July 30, 2024, I was terminated without cause by the Debtor as \nRepresentative Director of FTX Holdings (Exhibit 26).   \nI. \nCLAIM FROM FTX\u2019S ACQUISITION OF  \nLIQUID SHARES (CLAIM #3385) \n \n34. \nAt the outset, it should be noted that Claim #3385 is for damages that I have \nincurred on account of my sale of shares in Liquid to FTX.  \n35.

In addition, the \ntarget company (Liquid) being acquired was domiciled in Japan. I was resident in Japan at the \ntime FTX acquired Liquid, of which I then owned  ~22% of the shares.

Pursuant to 2.4 of the SPA, the Retained Consideration was to \nbe held,  \u201cin a manner to be agreed in good faith by the Purchaser and the \nManagement Shareholders.\u201d  Although the Retained Consideration was paid to me on \nthe completion date, FTX held it as security for any Indemnification Obligation.   \n38. \nOver 2 years have passed since the April 4, 2022, completion date but no \nwarranty claim was made by the Purchaser (FTX).   \n39. \nAs set forth below, FTX made a multitude of misrepresentations to me to \ninduce me to sell my entire interest in Liquid, a successful cryptocurrency exchange with \nrelevant JFSA licenses, a large and growing user base, and profitable operations in the full \nyear before FTX s acquisition of Liquid was completed on April 4, 2022.  The \nmisrepresentations included, among other things, (i) false and misleading audited financial \nstatements,  (ii) misstatements as to how FTX was operated, (iii) fabricated public-facing \nwarranties on FTX\u2019s risk management controls, and (iv) false statements concerning  FTX\u2019s \nrelationship with related entities. These misrepresentations breached the Purchaser, FTX\u2019s \nwarranties spelled out in 7.2 SPA because FTX warranted the statements it made to me were \n\u201ctrue, accurate and not misleading at the date of this agreement.\u201d SPA 7.2.  \n40. \nIn my experience at Goldman Sachs and FTX Japan KK, asset segregation had \nan important role in protecting customers from the risk of insolvency by the exchange or \nbroker. A crucial step in protecting customers is segregating the customer assets in their \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 12 of 26\n\n \n13 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \naccounts from the assets of the operating entity by storing customers' assets in the hands of \nlegally independent custodians and/or in segregated wallets or accounts.   \n41. \nMy knowledge of the importance of customer asset segregation, in both crypto \nand conventional finance, combined with FTX s published claims that FTX protected and \nsegregated customer assets, gave me confidence FTX was not only a fast-growing but a well-\ngoverned exchange with appropriate levels of control over customer assets, to protect its \ncustomers both outside and inside the regime of bankruptcy that it is now enduring.  \n42. \nFTX\u2019s published its Key Principles on December 3, 2021, prior to the April 4, \n2022 completion date, which assured me that FTX would segregate my own Retained \nConsideration from FTX\u2019s assets as conscientiously as FTX segregated customers' crypto \nassets.   \nA. False FTX audited, consolidated financial statements \n43. \nPrior to execution of  the SPA, FTX management and Sam Bankman Fried \nprovided Liquid\u2019s management audited, consolidated financial statements of FTX and its \nsubsidiaries from Prager Metis CPAs, LLC Hackensack, NJ, (the \u201cPrager Audited \nFinancials\u201d).  On or about September 3, 2021, Sam Bankman Fried, CEO of FTX, provided \nto Liquid management  the  consolidated balance sheets of FTX for December 31, 2019 and \n2020, related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for \nthe period April 2, 2019 to December 31, 2019, and year ended December 31, 2020, and the \nrelated notes to the financial statements.  (Exhibit 16).  These documents were deposited in a \nVirtual Data Room [VDR] to which Liquid\u2019s executives were given access in September \n2021 via an email sent by Can Sun, the then Chief Legal Officer of FTX, on September 17, \n2021.  \n44. \nThese financial statements were incomplete and false in material respects \nwhen I received them. In particular, The Prager audited, financial statements did not disclose \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 13 of 26\n\n \n14 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \nshortfalls of customer balances.   As stated in the Second Interim Report of John J. Ray III To \nThe Independent Directors [D.I. 1704-1] (the \u201cSecond Interim Report\u201d):7 \nAt times, the FTX Senior Executives, with Caroline Ellison and certain other \nemployees, estimated their growing liabilities in internal communications. By August \n2022, the FTX Senior Executives and Ellison privately estimated that the FTX.com \nexchange owed customers over $8 billion in fiat currency that it did not have. \n \nSecond Interim Report at 18.   \n \n45. \nNo FTX employee or representative disclosed this shortfall in public or in \ndirect communications to me or other Liquid shareholders during the exchange of due \ndiligence information between September and November of 2021, thereby breaching its \nwarranties. 7.2 SPA \n46. \nFTX\u2019s audited financial statements were intended to\u201cfairly present in all \nmaterial respects the financial condition and operating results of\u201d FTX, but do not include \ninformation about Alameda\u2019s undocumented \u201cline of credit\u201d from FTX and other information \ndiscussed herein.  I read and analyzed the materially misleading Prager Audited Financials in \nthe VDR, which evidenced  FTX was a sound financial entity, on which I relied, before I sold \nmy LGI stock and warrants to FTX on November 19, 2021. Nothing in FTX\u2019s consolidated \nfinancial statements revealed the fraudulent and criminal activity of FTX\u2019s management later \nexposed in criminal trials and plea agreements.  The criminal dockets of  Nishad Singh and \nGary Wang are available [] \nFTX false representations of  customer asset segregation \n47. \nDuring the due diligence process conducted before Liquid was sold to  FTX,  I \nexplained FTX Japan\u2019s adherence to the regulations which required daily reconciliation and \ncustomer asset segregation.    FTX executives Sam Bankman-Fried and Can Sun assured me \nthat FTX also maintained sound risk management and daily customer reconciliations as part \n \n7 The Second Interim Report is available at https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-Download \nPDF?id1=MTUzNzc0OA==&id2=-1  \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 14 of 26\n\n \n15 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \nof its operating framework.  In its \u201cKey Principles\u201d8 published on the FTX website on \nDecember 3, 2021, FTX expounded on its innovations to reduce risk and ensure that \ncustomer accounts did not go negative:  \n\u25cf \u201cSecond, FTX and other crypto platforms have brought important innovations to \ntrading, and a sound framework should preserve these innovations.  This is because \nthey minimize risk, promote capital efficiency, and protect investors, all of which \nbetter serve the public. Some of the key innovations include: automated risk-\nmanagement systems that ensure customer accounts trading multiple different assets \ndo not go net negative across customer positions; 24/7 trading hours, which also \nreduces risk; permissioning a non-intermediated market structure that gives all \ninvestors the same equal access to the market and helps minimize conflicts of interest; \nand free-market data that aligns the platform operator's interest with the investor's.\u201d  \n \n48. \nThe Key Principles went on to state: \n\u25cf FTX regularly reconciles customers\u2019 trading balances against cash and digital assets \nheld by FTX. Additionally, as a general principle FTX segregates customer assets \nfrom its own assets across our platforms . . . . \n \n49. \nFTX\u2019s Key Principles, made public in December 2021, were a confirmation of \nwhat I had already been told by FTX executives about how customer protections were \nimplemented at FTX.  The misleading, inaccurate representations of Sam Bankman Fried and \nCan Sun  that customer asset segregation was institutionalized and that no commingling of \ncustomer assets was permitted at FTX occurred between August 31, 2021 and November \n2021, which predated the sale of Liquid to FTX.  FTX warranties about risk management, \ncustomer protections, and segregation of customers\u2019 funds indicated to me an alignment at \nFTX with how I had operated FTX Japan.  This illustrates the pervasive breach of warranties \nthat existed during the due diligence process culminating in the sale of LGI to FTX \nB. False assurances of exchange \u201cinsurance funds\u201d \n \n8 \nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-issues-key-principles-for-market-regulation-of-crypto-trading-\nplatforms-301437175.html  \n \n \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 15 of 26\n\n \n16 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \n50. \nAn \u201cinsurance fund\u201d at a derivatives exchange like FTX is a reserve of capital \nused to cover losses when traders\u2019 positions are liquidated and their losses exceed their initial \nmargin. Such a fund ensures that an exchange remains solvent so that market participants are \ncompensated for losses even in highly volatile market conditions.  \n51. \nThe claims made by FTX about insurance funds in their Key Principles, which \nI relied upon, were also materially false.  As per the FTX report dated June 26, 2023 Page 17 \nparagraph D: \u201cFalsity of Claim to Reconcile Trading Balances:\u201d \nThe FTX Group lied in its Key Principles that it \u2018regularly reconcile[d] customers\u2019 \ntrading balances against funds held by the exchanges. In fact, Debtors identify no \nevidence that the FTX Group performed any meaningful reconciliation prior to \nmaking this claim on its website and in materials provided to Congress, federal \nagencies, and other third parties. \n \n52. \nOn October 6, 2023, Gary Wang, who was FTX's Co-Founder and Chief \nTechnology Officer, testified at Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal trial that FTX\u2019s insurance \nfund values published by FTX on its website and on social media were fabricated.   On \nFebruary 13, 2021, FTX represented in a generally published Tweet (on Twitter)  the \ninsurance fund was  worth \u201cover 100,000,000 USD.\u201d \nhttps://x.com/FTX_Official/status/1360858165802197003  \n53. \nIn his criminal trial testimony, Wang admitted insurance fund values \npublished by FTX were actually created using a random number generator and did not \nrepresent actual reserves held by FTX.  When the Prosecution asked Wang at Bankman \nFried\u2019s criminal trial whether this \u201cinsurance fund\u201d amount was accurate, he replied with a \nsingle word: \u201cNo.\u201d   \n54. \nWang went on to testify,  \u201cFor one, there is no FTT (tokens) in the insurance \nfund. It\u2019s just the USD number. And, two, the number listed here does not match what was in \nthe database.\u201d  Wang testified that a random figure, roughly 7,500, was multiplied by the \nexchange's daily trade volume in order to generate the insurance fund value that was \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 16 of 26\n\n \n17 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \npublished by FTX.  Thus, FTX materially overstated the value of its insurance fund in its \nTweet and on its website by claiming a value of $100 million.   \n55. \nThe portion of FTX\u2019s website that revealed the volatile insurance fund value \nhas been withdrawn from FTX\u2019s website post-petition. Based on my own experience running \na cryptocurrency exchange as the COO of Liquid Group Inc., I was aware that the insurance \nfund provides a safety net for users in case of unforeseen events like hacking, fraud, or \nfailures in risk management of derivatives trading. The false assurances of the existence of a \nlarge insurance fund, which FTX touted to customers and the general public, gave me \nconfidence FTX was a well-run, financially stable firm with solid risk management controls \nin place. The baseless and fraudulent insurance-fund representations also led me to believe \nFTX had profitable operations and significant resources available because FTX was able to \nset aside nearly $100 million from its operating capital to protect FTX.com exchange users. \nThe overstated insurance fund data, in addition to my reliance on FTX\u2019s inaccurate Prager \nconsolidated financial statements, were factors in inducing me (and the other shareholders) to \nsell the shares of LGI holdings to FTX.  \nC. Concealment of extraordinary privileges given to Alameda Research  \n56. \nFTX hid the extraordinary privileges extended to Alameda Research on the \nFTX.com platform from its customers, LGI shareholders and myself.   These privileges \nincluded, but were not limited to, the no-liquidation feature and a change in the configuration \nfiles that extended a $65 billion credit line to Alameda Research.   \n57. \nAs per the Debtor\u2019s report on CONTROL FAILURES AT THE FTX \nEXCHANGES on April 9, 2023 P.18 \u00b6 6: \nThe FTX Group configured the codebase of FTX.com and associated customer databases to \ngrant Alameda an effectively limitless ability to trade and withdraw assets from the exchange \nregardless of the size of Alameda\u2019s account balance, and to exempt Alameda from the auto-\nliquidation process that applied to other customers. Any number of different controls \nroutinely implemented by financial institutions and exchanges in established financial markets \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 17 of 26\n\n \n18 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \nwould be expected to have prevented, detected, and escalated these secret privileges to \npersonnel in control functions with sufficient independence and authority to address the issue. \n \n58. \nAt Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal trial, Gary Wang testified about the undisclosed \nline of credit to Alameda as follows: \"The first time, we picked a number so high that it would never \nbe hit, the number we picked was $1 billion, and then it was hit again, and then the number picked \nwas $65 billion.\"  \n59. \nThe exceptions granted to Alameda Research with an undisclosed line of \ncredit were critical departures from the requirements for a sound cryptocurrency exchange. \nThe changes to the FTX codebase allowed for the large negative balance at Alameda \nResearch account at FTX.com. This enabled Alameda Research to drain funds from FTX, \nmaking FTX insolvent. There was no disclosure of the Alameda Research credit line in the \nPrager Metis audited financial statements for FTX covering 2019 and 2020 provided to \nLiquid management, nor in the March 2021 FTX Trading Balance Sheet (Exhibit 11) \npresented to Liquid and its shareholders. \n60. \nSince the founding of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried had repeatedly claimed in \npublic forums that FTX and Alameda Research were managed separately.  Sam Bankman \nFried and Can Sun told me in September of 2021 that Alameda Research was not given \nspecial privileges on the FTX exchange.  The FTX Terms of Service also clarified that \nAlameda had no special privileges.    \u201cAffiliates of FTX Trading may execute trades on the \nPlatform provided, however, that such Affiliates shall not be afforded any priority in trade \nexecution.\u201d During his testimony at the criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, Wang testified \nthat Alameda Research:  \u201chad the ability to place orders slightly faster than other accounts.\u201d   \n61. \nThe omission of this fact caused me to have an incorrect understanding of the \nintegrity of FTX operations. Had it been generally known, this special access would \ndiscourage customers from using the FTX exchange and risk a loss of operating licenses were \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 18 of 26\n\n \n19 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \nit made known to Regulators.  The deception regarding Alameda\u2019s special market access hid \na major red flag which led to Liquid\u2019s sale to FTX. \n \nD. False 31 March 2021 FTX Trading Balance Sheet \n62. \nFTX provided LGI shareholders the March 31, 2021, FTX Trading Ltd. \nBalance sheet.  (Exhibit 11).  This balance sheet was provided via the VDR to Liquid \nmanagement in September 2021. The FTX Balance Sheet omitted mention of the line of \ncredit with Alameda Research or the existence of any negative customer balances.  The \nMarch 31, 2021 balance sheet provided by debtors showed that as of March 31, 2021 the total \nintercompany receivables equaled $997,063.61.  There was no mention of the line of credit \nwith Alameda Research in the balance sheet, leading me to believe that there was no large or \nhidden liability of or risk to FTX Trading Ltd. in its dealings with Alameda Research or any \nother entity.  Based on my experience operating a cryptocurrency exchange, the March 31, \n2021 FTX Balance Sheet gave the impression of being a well-run exchange that was \nprofitable with no significant payables or liabilities that would impact its liquidity or \nsolvency.  \nE. Fraud in connection with FTX\u2019 B-1 Round of External Financing \n63. \nDuring the negotiations for the sale of Liquid in 2021, FTX executive Can Sun \nshared an email with me and other LGI management on 31 August 2021 (Exhibit 12) with an \nattached document titled FTX B-1 Round Terms (Exhibit 13) Paragraph  3 b) of the FTX B-\n1 Round Terms highlights the repurchase price of FTX shares from Binance: \n\u201cSecondary common shares at $23.658/share (~$16.15B valuation). This is the same \nprice at which Alameda Research bought Binance\u2019s common stock in FTX Trading \nLTD last month (~$2.3B total purchase), reducing Binance\u2019s ownership stake in FTX \nTrading LTD to zero.\u201d \n \n64. \nThe repurchase of FTX common shares by an entity [Alameda Research] \neffectively controlled by the FTX CEO indicated to me that FTX was making progress in \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 19 of 26\n\n \n20 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \ncleaning up its shareholder table. Binance was sanctioned by regulators around the world in \n2021 including, UK, Germany, and Japan.  There were also ongoing investigations by US \nregulatory agencies into the operational practices at Binance.  \n65. \nAs someone who had worked on licensing initiatives in Singapore and Japan, I \nknew  removing Binance from the FTX shareholder registry was an important step forward \nfor FTX to achieve its strategic goals of gaining operating licenses in global jurisdictions. \nMost, if not all, regulators will do a \u201cfit and proper,\u201d assessment of shareholders of the parent \ncompany.  Based on our experience in  regulatory licensing of Liquid\u2019s subsidiaries in \nSingapore and Japan, I shared FTX\u2019s stated belief that cryptocurrency exchange businesses \nthat were licensed had a clearer path for sustainable growth. The removal of Binance from the \nFTX shareholder registry indicated to me  FTX was taking the necessary steps in the \ndirection of compliance and licensing.  FTX\u2019s strategy of working with regulators on \nobtaining licenses and seeking to develop regulatory frameworks for the growth of crypto as \nan asset class appealed to me and made a potential FTX acquisition of Liquid an attractive \nproposition. \n66. \nHowever, aspects of this supposedly salubrious \u201cclearing of the share registry\u201d \nwere materially fraudulent.  During the criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, Professor \nEaston\u2019s analysis submitted to the court showed that $1.2bn of the $2.3bn purchase of FTX \nshares from Binance had been sourced from FTX customer funds (Exhibit 28).  The use of \nclient funds to re-purchase the FTX shares from Binance in July 2021 was a material \nmisappropriation of client funds, which was known to the FTX  executives (including Sam \nBankman-Fried) but not myself when I was induced to sell my share of Liquid to FTX in the \nfall of 2021.  \n67. \nIn addition to fraud, the undisclosed use of customer assets to acquire Binance \nshares in FTX  breached the warranty provisions of paragraph 7.2 of the SPA. SPA\u2019s \u00b69.2, P. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 20 of 26\n\n \n21 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \n21, states that the remedies available to me as Seller for FTX furnishing inaccurate \ninformation  include recovering \u201call losses\u201d for \u201c\u201dany breach of representations and \nwarranties made by Purchaser [FTX] under clause (\u00b6) 7.2 \u2026 under this (SPA) agreement.\u201d \nUnder  \u00b67.2,  FTX as Purchaser \u201crepresents and warrants\u201d . . . \u201cthat each warranty is true, \naccurate and not misleading . . . .\u201d  \n \n68. \nThe Prager Metis Audited Financials failed to reveal: \n\u201cFTX Group commingled customer deposits and corporate funds,\u201d facts upon which I \nrelied in selling my LGI holdings to FTX.  Together with FTX\u2019s inaccurate insurance \nfund representations, FTX\u2019s financial statements did not reveal that Alameda \nResources had access to FTX cash and customer assets, as evidenced by Debtor\u2019s 6-\n23-23 Report and by the February 28, 2023, criminal dockets of Caroline Ellison \n(CEO of Alameda Research), Gary Wang, the co-founder and former Chief \nTechnology Officer, Nishad Singh, the former director of engineering at FTX, who \npleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud. Ex. 4. \n \n69. \nPrager Metis\u2019 audited, FTX consolidated financial statements constituted a \u00b67.2 SPA \nbreach of warranty, causing Liquid shareholders, including myself, to suffer the losses claimed.\"  In \naddition to liability for fraud in the inducement, simple common-law fraud, and breach of \ncontract/warranty, FTX is liable for those losses for failing to indemnify me for them as required by \nthe SPA.  See  \u00b69.23 SPA, P. 21. (requiring FTX to reimburse \u201call Losses incurred by any of the \nSellers Indemnified Parties resulting from, relating to or arising out of any breach of the \nrepresentations and warranties made by the Purchaser\u2026\").

Ltd. (FTX Singapore), before I signed \nthe SPA on Nov 19, 2021, which contract closed with \u201cCompletion\u201d on April 4, 2022.  Until \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 21 of 26\n\n \n22 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \nJuly 30, 2024, I  continued to be the Representative Director of FTX Japan Holdings KK and \nDirector of FTX Singapore.   \n71. \nI seek payment, with interest, of my September and October 2022 Director\u2019s \nfees of $26,250/month due from FTX Singapore as required by \u00b64.2(b) of the October 19, \n2022, Amended and Restated Management Agreement (hereafter referred to as \u201cMA\u201d. \n(Exhibit 8).  These sums were due to me prior to the Petition Date. \n \n72. I was appointed Director of FTX Singapore (Quoine Pte. Ltd) on  August 26, 2022. \n(Exhibit 17).  In conjunction with this appointment, the Management Agreement was \namended on 19 Oct 2022 effective September 1, 2022, re-apportioning the payment of \nmy Directors\u2019 fees between FTX Singapore and FTX Japan.  (Exhibit 8).  My pre- \nand post-petition Directors fees are justified because I operated FTX Singapore in my \ncapacity as COO and Director both before and after FTX filed its bankruptcy petition.  \nParagraph 4.2(b) of the MA states FTX Japan Holdings \u201cshall cause\u201d FTX Singapore \nto pay 70% of my Director's fees in the amount of $26,250/month.   \n \n73. FTX Japan Holdings caused FTX Singapore to pay my $26,500/mo Directors fees \npost-petition pursuant to this court\u2019s November 22, 2022 Order through July 2024, \nacknowledging  I performed critical and necessary services for both entities. \n74. \nThe Objection states that \u201cClaim 3353 should be disallowed because FTX \nSingapore is not a party to the Management Agreement.\u201d Debtors\u2019 Objection\u00b636 This \nargument conveniently ignores that FTX Japan Holdings, KK is a party to the Management \nAgreement, and FTX Japan Holdings, KK is the 100% shareholder of FTX Singapore.  As \nthe exclusive shareholder of FTX Singapore,  FTX Japan Holdings KK is able to and must \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 23172    Filed 08/16/24    Page 22 of 26\n\n \n23 \n \nME1 47657999v.1ME1 47657999v.1 \ncause  FTX Singapore to make payments of my  $26,250/mo. Director\u2019s fees, as required by \n\u00b64.2(b) of the Management Agreement. \n75. \nThe Objection states that my Unpaid Compensation and Bonus Claims should \nbe disallowed on the basis that I am a \u201cquintessential insider.\u201d  Objection \u00b6 38.  I take issue \nwith this characterization because it insinuates I was somehow involved in the FTX scandal.  \nThe Management Agreement defined my roles, responsibilities and compensation at FTX \nJapan, FTX Japan Holdings and FTX Singapore, not at FTX Trading Ltd., the parent \ncompany.  The Management Agreement gave executives at FTX the power to dismiss me at \nwill, at any time.  I had no knowledge of actions taken by FTX executives that precipitated \nFTX\u2019s decision to file its Chapter 11 petition.   Most of the actions taken by FTX executives \nthat led to the downfall of FTX Trading Ltd. and its subsidiaries began before Liquid was \nacquired by FTX in April 2022.  FTX Japan, which was FTX Trading Ltd.\u2019s subsidiary at \nwhich I served as COO, never filed bankruptcy in Japan, its country of domicile. FTX Japan \nproperly segregated client assets and has subsequently been dismissed from the Chapter 11 \nproceedings via a sale, Doc 17923, filed July 20, 2024.   \n76. \nThe Objection further states that my Unpaid Compensation and Bonus Claims \nbe limited to the reasonable value of the services.  As reflected above,  the reasonable value \nof my services is in excess of the amount claimed for Unpaid Compensation and Bonus.

We \npresent evidence indicating that S&C had undisclosed potential conflicts of interest due to \napparent errors, omissions, and deceptions in their work for the company and its founder, \nSam Bankman-Fried, before, at, and during the bankruptcy, thereby undermining the \nfirst-order public interest in procedural integrity.

S&C \noften justified its actions by reference to the third, \u201cother\u201d facet of the public interest. \nNamely, S&C touted that it supported the prosecution of disfavored insiders such as \nBankman-Fried. But that pricey task\u2014for which S&C billed millions of dollars\u2014may have \ndistorted the prosecutions without producing observable economic benefit to the \nbankruptcy estate. \nFTX is a cautionary tale about the power that lawyers have to frame, control, and profit \nfrom claims about the public interest in chapter 11. An examiner appointed late in the case \nlargely exonerated S&C, although he engaged little of the evidence we present. This is not \nsurprising because S&C\u2019s resistance to that intervention left a narrow scope and little time \nfor his investigation. \nWe situate our findings in a nascent body of literature exploring the public interest in \nbankruptcy. We suggest that the experience with S&C in FTX may reflect larger patterns \nin reorganization reminiscent of historical concerns about distorted incentives in \nrestructuring processes. To ameliorate these concerns, we offer guidance to improve the \nfunctioning of the principal custodians of the public interest in chapter 11. Courts should \nmore carefully police prebankruptcy connections of estate professionals and should use \npreliminary examinations more frequently. We further believe that the United States \nTrustee should have greater independence from other government actors so it can fulfill \nits watchdog mandate without compromise. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN.

We use the recent and controversial FTX bankruptcy as a case study to \nclarify and offer guidance on the public interests at stake in large-scale \ncorporate reorganizations. \nDiscussions of the public interest in corporate reorganization are often \nnebulous because there are multiple versions of it in chapter 11, the \nreorganization provisions in current bankruptcy law.2 We identify three: \n\u2022 \nFirst, and most important, is the paramount interest in the integrity of \nthe judicial process.3 \n\u2022 \nSecond is the pursuit of bankruptcy- or insolvency-specific objectives, \nsuch as providing a collective judicial forum for resolving financial \ndistress and maximizing the value of a debtor\u2019s assets in bankruptcy.4 \n\u2022 \nThird, and last, is the pursuit of non-bankruptcy public-interest \nobjectives, such as the Chrysler bankruptcy\u2019s effort to develop energy-\nefficient cars5 or Purdue Pharma\u2019s effort to abate the opioid crisis.6 \nIn FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange\u2019s bankruptcy attorneys and other \nprofessionals provided millions of dollars of assistance to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s \noffice, in furtherance of the public interest in a robust fraud prosecution of \n \n 1.

We argue that when the \ngovernment or a party seeks to use bankruptcy to advance non-bankruptcy \npublic interests, it is especially important to police judicial-process integrity \nand the bankruptcy objective of maximizing the value of the estate. \nThe modern pecking order of public-interest objectives is ironic in light of \nthe history of such interests in reorganization. When large-scale corporate \nreorganization emerged in the nineteenth century as a device for restructuring \nthe obligations of struggling railroads, the parties pursued the three forms of \npublic interest in precisely the opposite order of importance.8 Parties condoned \nsham sales and collusively obtained jurisdiction because the reorganizations \nserved a non-bankruptcy public interest: keeping America\u2019s railroads \nrunning.9 But by the 1930s, the Supreme Court had had enough. The Court \nsignaled that it would tolerate the assault on judicial integrity in common-\ncarrier cases due to the special public interest at stake, but would not with \nother types of corporate debtors.10 Congress thereafter codified large-scale \ncorporate reorganization in 1933 and 1934, removing the need for collusion \nand sham sales, while also achieving the bankruptcy-specific public interest of \nproviding a collective proceeding to preserve value and efficiently resolve \nfinancial distress in a market economy.11 \nEven so, the New Deal Congress went too far, imposing a restrictive \n\u201cdisinterestedness\u201d standard that made it impractical for major Wall Street \nlawyers and investment firms to continue their earlier restructuring \npractices.12 Recognizing this, in 1978 Congress relaxed the definition of \n\u201cdisinterestedness\u201d as part of a larger effort to make chapter 11 more appealing \nto corporate debtors and those who would represent them. Having represented \na debtor before its distress was no longer per se disqualifying.13 By this time, \n \n 7. See infra Part III.B. \n 8. See infra Part I.A. \n 9. See infra Part I.B. \n 10.

L. REV. 369 (2025) \n375 \nhowever, a different norm had also taken hold: rather than relying on existing \nlawyers, large corporations typically hired a new law firm if they fell into \nfinancial distress. \nAs we shall see, the FTX bankruptcy is a stark departure from this pattern \nand a throwback to pre-New Deal norms. Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C), FTX\u2019s \nbankruptcy counsel, represented FTX well before its financial distress, during \na period when FTX committed massive fraud.14 During that time, S&C may \nwell have known of, or missed red flags signaling, FTX\u2019s misconduct.15 While \nthis Article focuses on FTX, S&C\u2019s pre-distress involvement is only the most \nvivid and troubling example of what we fear is an emerging pattern across \nbankruptcy cases. \nPrior to its fall, FTX was a multibillion-dollar enterprise that consisted of \ncryptocurrency exchanges and a hedge fund, all founded by Sam Bankman-\nFried. During the height of the crypto frenzy in 2021 and early 2022, Bankman-\nFried seemed to be the voice of trust and reason in the otherwise wild crypto \nworld. He repeatedly promised customers that their accounts were safe, and \nthat FTX would not use their assets for its own, or others\u2019, purposes.16 \nWhereas the head of FTX\u2019s main competitor, Binance, positioned himself as a \nrenegade who despised regulators, FTX sought credibility with investors, \nregulators, and even celebrities.17 This credibility benefitted from the \ncompany\u2019s affiliation with S&C, an elite New York firm which represented the \ncompany in important regulatory efforts to legitimize and rationalize digital \nassets before bankruptcy.18 \n \ntrustee in conducting the case, an attorney that has represented the debtor, if in the best \ninterests of the estate\u201d). \n 14.

Some has been provided by third parties whom we \nconsider reliable for these purposes. The full story may be more complex than \nwe know. But the evidence is suggestive and warrants close examination. At \nminimum, it exposes serious flaws in chapter 11\u2019s architecture for defining and \nprotecting the public interest, and for managing conflicts among public and \nprivate interests in large bankruptcy cases. \nThe Bankruptcy Code has rules and processes to guard against conflicts of \ninterest.32 But we argue that FTX demonstrates that these rules and processes \nare insufficient in their current form, because the very agents whose \nindependence matters control those processes. Thus, those agents can evade the \nenforcement of conflicts rules. \nConcerned about the public interest in FTX, the United States Trustee\u2014an \narm of the Department of Justice and the principal watchdog in \nbankruptcy33\u2014initially objected to S&C\u2019s retention by FTX.34 The U.S. \n \n 29.

Notably, this \noccurred with Binance, which apparently took over $2 billion out of FTX \nprior to bankruptcy.44 \nFTX reveals the significant and underappreciated power that the debtor\u2019s \ncounsel has to shape and arbitrate among the three types of public interest \nwhen they conflict. Moreover, it spotlights counsel\u2019s ability to privilege their \nown private interests, whether by avoiding scrutiny if they represented the \ndebtor prior to its distress or by billing hundreds of millions of dollars in the \nprocess.45 \nIn addition to revealing new information about the FTX bankruptcy, we \nconnect growing awareness of the public interest in chapter 11 to the \nincentives of those who run the process. By reporting concerns about \nmisconduct at FTX to prosecutors, S&C offered the government solutions to \ntwo persistent problems: (i) the need to show force in the face of an \nunregulated crypto market46 and (ii) the interest in prosecuting individuals for \norganizational crimes, after failing to do so during the Great Recession.47 In \nexchange, S&C would get to shield its reputation, charge millions of dollars, \nand return to a practice area\u2014restructuring\u2014that it initially helped invent but \nhad abandoned after the New Deal.

There is \ngrowing awareness that lawyers who run chapter 11 cases may have or \nrepresent parties with conflicting incentives, such as where the same firm \nrepresents both the debtor and its principal equity holder.49 These appear to be \nmodern versions of historic conflicts of interests in restructuring practice. \nThe Article proceeds as follows. Part I provides a brief historical overview, \nfocusing on public-interest considerations that spurred Congress to create a \nlarge-scale reorganization framework and on the complications that ensued. It \nshows that conflicts of interest were a significant problem in the late \nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the receiverships that \nforeshadowed chapter 11. \nThe FTX case study is in Parts II through V. The case study shows how \nefforts to advance non-bankruptcy public interests can subvert higher-order \ninterests in process integrity and maximizing recoveries. Part II describes \nS&C\u2019s prebankruptcy role at FTX, which may have exposed it to red flags of \nthe company\u2019s wrongdoing. That Part also presents evidence that S&C misled \nBankman-Fried in the tumultuous 72-hour period leading to the bankruptcy \nfilings, raising questions about the ethics of its conduct. \nParts III and IV chronicle the contested hearings on the retention of S&C as \nFTX\u2019s bankruptcy counsel and on the U.S. Trustee\u2019s request for an examiner, as \nwell as the prosecution of Sam Bankman-Fried taking place at the same time. \nS&C resisted the appointment of an examiner and seemed at times to act as an \nexpensive back office for prosecutors in New York, advancing the firm\u2019s \ninterests while distorting the criminal justice and reorganization processes. \nWe also assess the Examiner\u2019s Report that was filed late in the bankruptcy. \nPart V shows how the effects of S&C\u2019s potential conflicts, unchecked by \nthe timely appointment of an examiner, permeated the case, including through \nproblematic asset sales to insiders and the failure to sue Binance. Those failures \nmay have eroded stakeholder recoveries and confidence in the judicial process. \nThis Part also explains why stakeholders may have tolerated this. \nPart VI shifts to larger implications and correctives, generalizing the \nlessons of FTX for analysis of competing public and private interests in \nbankruptcy and the role of the debtor\u2019s attorney, the examiner, and the U.S. \nTrustee. \nI. \nThe Roots of Bankruptcy\u2019s Public Interests \nCorporate reorganization under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code seems, \nand is often seen, to be a private system for restructuring financially distressed \n \n 49.

REV. 369 (2025) \n382 \ncorporations.50 A creditors\u2019 committee is appointed early in the case to \nrepresent the interests of general creditors,51 and the managers of a corporate \ndebtor negotiate with senior creditors and the creditors\u2019 committee over the \nterms of a restructuring. A bankruptcy judge must confirm any proposed \nreorganization plan,52 but the judge serves primarily as referee of a process run \nby the parties themselves, usually through their lawyers. \nYet American corporate reorganization has always had public dimensions, \ndating back to its origins in the nineteenth century. In this Part, we resurface \nthree different forms of public interest as they emerged historically in \nAmerican corporate reorganization. We conclude by briefly describing the \nproblem of law firm conflicts of interest in chapter 11, which go to the heart of \nthe first-order public interest in process integrity, and which will prove \nimportant when we turn to the FTX case in the parts that follow. \nA. The Public Interest and the Railroad Receivership \nThe history of corporate reorganization in America is closely linked to the \nrailroads, which became a crucial mode of transportation in the nineteenth \ncentury.53 A bit like crypto, the railroads expanded rapidly and unevenly, with \nentrepreneurs trying to cobble together smaller railroads into interstate \nrailroads that controlled important routes or fighting over a well-positioned \nexisting railroad.54 Railroad expansion was financed with debt, much as \ntakeovers are today.55 As a result, if the economy crashed, as it did with \nalarming regularity in the nineteenth century, many railroads would default.56 \n \n 50.

REV. 1715, 1721 \n(2018) (criticizing this tendency and stating that \u201c[c]orporate bankruptcy\u2019s frequent \ncharacterization as private law, rather than public law or a hybrid, is curious and \noverdue for interrogation\u201d); see also Jonathan C.

REV. 369 (2025) \n383 \nAfter the 1893 Panic, 19% of all railroad track miles in America were in \ndefault.57 \nThe financial distress of a railroad, like that of any complex network, \ncreated a conundrum. Every constituency was rooting for the railroad to \nsurvive\u2014including the state and federal governments given the public interest \nin railroad transportation\u2014but it was not clear there was constitutional \nauthority to create a railroad reorganization law.58 The dilemma was resolved \nby molding humble foreclosure law into the world\u2019s first large-scale \nreorganization framework.59 In a process that became known as the equity \nreceivership, one or more creditors would file a \u201ccreditors\u2019 bill\u201d asking the \ncourt to appoint a receiver to take control of the assets of the corporation.60 \nAnother creditor would file a foreclosure bill, saying that the railroad had \ndefaulted on the bonds and asking the court to commence a foreclosure sale.61 \nBut the parties would request that the court temporarily postpone the sale.62 In \nthe meantime, the Wall Street banks that had underwritten classes of stock or \nbonds would form committees to represent the stock or bondholders, and the \nbankers and lawyers representing the committees would negotiate with the \nmanagers of the railroad over the terms of a restructuring.63 After agreeing on \nthe terms, they would combine the committees into a single reorganization \ncommittee.64 They would then invite the court to hold the foreclosure sale, at \nwhich exactly one bidder would appear: the reorganization committee,65 \n \n 57.

If the problem arose today, Congress would point to the Bankruptcy Clause in Article I \nof the U.S. Constitution as authority. Id. at 52-56.

The receivership and foreclosure bills \nwere often filed by friendly creditors\u2014the product of collusion rather than an \narms-length use of the legal system.72 Transferring the railroad\u2019s assets to a \nreceiver stymied most creditors (the outside creditors who were not in on the \ngame) from exercising their remedies under state law, such as the right to sue \nand obtain a lien on the debtor\u2019s property.73 And the terms of the restructuring \noften ignored basic payment priorities, allowing current shareholders to \nmaintain a stake in the reorganized railroad while giving little or nothing to \ncreditors who were not viewed as necessary to the future of the railroad.74 \n \n 66.

REV. 369 (2025) \n385 \nIn effect, judges held their noses when they approved the sham sale and \nother transactions at the heart of the equity receivership, due to the public \ninterest in ensuring a robust system of railroads.75 The equity receivership thus \nachieved one public objective\u2014ensuring a viable transportation system\u2014but \nthreatened to undermine another: the fairness and integrity of the judicial \nsystem. \nThe extent of the incursion on the integrity of the legal system depended \nin part on how honestly and effectively the Wall Street bankers and law \nfirms\u2014including S&C\u2014represented ordinary investors who had bought the \nstock or bonds. When a bank formed a protective committee, it asked the \nbondholders to \u201cdeposit\u201d their bonds with the bank.76 From this point on, the \nbank had almost complete authority to determine how the bond was treated in \nthe restructuring.77 With little role in the process and little visibility into the \nnegotiations, bondholders were at the mercy of the bank that represented \nthem. A faithful representative would negotiate the best possible treatment of \nthe bonds and would ask only for reasonable fees; an unfaithful representative \nwould not. \nB. Stress-Tested by the Supreme Court in the 1930s \nOnce the receivership strategy was blessed by the courts, it migrated from \nrailroads to other industries. By the early twentieth century, a substantial \nnumber of receiverships involved non-railroad corporations.78 In a series of \ncases, the Supreme Court signaled that these receiverships needed to be more \ncarefully scrutinized.79 With railroads, the public interest in railroad \ntransportation outweighed the public interest in a procedurally fair and \nevenhanded judicial system.80 In other contexts, it might not. \n \n[reorganized company] . . . . they did not have to give a seat at the bargaining table to \nthose who invested in that track\u201d). \n 75.

Brundage, for example, the Daniel Boone Woolen Mills \nstruggled after its president and treasurer were replaced for mismanagement.81 \nOn February 14, 1925, a shareholder filed a receivership bill in Illinois state \ncourt asking for the appointment of a receiver.82 Five days later, a friendly \ncreditor who was allied with the current managers filed a receivership bill in a \nfederal district court.83 To ensure the federal receivership motion was heard \nfirst, the company\u2019s lawyer secured a delay (apparently with misleading \ntestimony) of the state-court proceeding.84 After two lower courts blessed the \nfederal receivership, the Supreme Court reversed.85 Chief Justice (and former \nPresident) Howard Taft might have upheld it \u201cif there had been no chicanery in \nthe delay of the proceeding in the state court\u201d\u2014that is, if the company\u2019s lawyer \nhad not misled both courts when he requested a delay.86 But he refused to \ncountenance this interference by a lawyer with the integrity of the legal \nsystem.87 \nFour years later, the Supreme Court again rejected a receivership on \njudicial-system integrity grounds. In Shapiro v. Wilgus, a lumber dealer who \nwas operating in his individual capacity transferred the assets of a business to a \nnewly created Delaware corporation for the purposes of having a receiver \nappointed.88 The receiver would prevent creditors from seizing the assets of \nthat business.89 The lumber dealer predicted \u201ca surplus of $100,000\u201d if the \nbusiness was \u201cprotected from the suits of creditors.\u201d90 Although the debtor\u2019s \nmotives were understandable, Justice Cardozo said the creation of a \n \n 81. 276 U.S. 36, 39 (1928). \n 82.

This is done not infrequently \nwhere the defendant is a public service corporation and the unbroken \nperformance of its services is in furtherance of the public good. It has been done at \ntimes, though the public good was not involved, where legitimate private \ninterests might otherwise have suffered harm. We have given warning more than \nonce, however, that the remedy in such circumstances is not to be granted \nloosely, but is to be watched with jealous eyes.93 \nJust what were the \u201clegitimate private interests\u201d justifying use of the \nreceivership strategy in the two non-railroad cases Justice Cardozo cites?94 In \neach case, a corporate debtor made a compelling showing that, unless a receiver \nwere appointed, creditors\u2019 collection efforts and the \u201cresulting forced sales of \nthe property would cause great loss to the creditors.\u201d95 Making a collective \nforum available to maximize the value of the debtor\u2019s assets serves the parties\u2019 \nprivate interests, but it also serves the public\u2019s interest in a functioning \neconomy.96 We characterize this as the second of three kinds of public interest \nin corporate reorganizations (the first being judicial-process integrity and the \nthird being non-bankruptcy interests). \nCongress codified large-scale railroad and non-railroad receivership for \nthe first time in 1933 and 1934, respectively, incorporating both into the \nBankruptcy Act.97 The new rules eliminated the need to engage in collusive \npractices under equity receiverships, reflecting a renewed commitment to the \n \n 91.

The Public Responsibilities of Lawyers \nReformers of the New Deal era, several of whom were corporate-\nreorganization experts, concluded that the 1933-1934 codification was \npathetically inadequate to assure the integrity of the system (the first public \ninterest in our schema).100 True, the reforms eliminated the need to use \ncollusive techniques. But the New Deal reformers believed that the Wall Street \nbankers and lawyers who negotiated the transactions were more concerned \nwith their own interests than with the ordinary investors they were ostensibly \nprotecting.101 \nIn 1934, Joseph Kennedy, the head of the newly created Securities and \nExchange Commission (SEC), asked future Supreme Court Justice William \nDouglas, then a Yale law professor, to oversee a study of corporate \nreorganization practice that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 instructed the \nSEC to undertake.102 Douglas and his team eventually produced eight volumes \nof case studies and analyses of reorganization practice.103 A recurring theme \nwas that bankers would seize control of the reorganizations for their own \npurposes while the lawyers would fail to uphold the high standards of their \nprofession.104 \nIn addition to a concern about fees,105 the report focused on conflicts of \ninterest. \u201cIt is not unusual,\u201d the investigators wrote, \u201cto find lawyers \nattempting to represent both senior and junior interests in a reorganization,\u201d \n \n 98.

They got their wish with the Chandler Act \nof 1938.109 Chapter X of the 1938 reforms, which governed large corporate \ndebtors, required that an independent trustee be appointed for any corporate \ndebtor with more than $250,000 of liabilities and prohibited a banker or lawyer \nfrom \nrepresenting \nthe \ntrustee \nin \nbankruptcy \nunless \nthey \nwere \n\u201cdisinterested.\u201d110 The definitions of \u201cdisinterested\u201d expressly excluded any \nbanker who had recently underwritten securities for the debtor and any \nlawyer that had worked for the company prior to bankruptcy.111 Major law \nfirms like S&C left restructuring practice as a result of the Chandler Act \nreforms.112 \nChapter X adopted a stringent vision for ensuring the fairness and \nintegrity of the judicial process and legal system, putting far greater emphasis \non this public-interest concern than either the equity receivership or the 1933-\n1934 codifications of large-scale reorganization had done. The lawyers at the \nheart of a large-scale reorganization were no longer lawyers who had \nrepresented the company or its underwriters prior to bankruptcy.

By the 1960s, an increasing number of large corporate debtors \nevaded Chapter X by filing under Chapter XI, which was intended for smaller \ncorporate debtors.113 This set the stage for the most recent overhaul of \nbankruptcy law in 1978. \nD. The Public Interest and the 1978 Code \nThe 1978 Bankruptcy Code dramatically reformed the reorganization of \nlarge corporate debtors. Chapter 11, the reorganization chapter, assumes that a \ndebtor\u2019s managers will continue to run the business,114 rather than \nautomatically replacing them with a trustee, as Chapter X had done. The \ndebtor and its creditors negotiate the terms of a potential reorganization plan, \nthe plan is voted on, and the bankruptcy court approves the plan if it meets a \nlist of requirements set forth in Section 1129.115 \nThe principal safeguards of the public interest in integrity and fairness in \nmost cases are extensive disclosure obligations and ethical oversight conducted \nby an entity created under the 1978 Code called the Office of the United States \nTrustee.116 The disclosure rules apply largely to the corporate debtor-in-\npossession and professionals retained by its estate. Debtors must, for example, \nfile schedules of assets and liabilities;117 a list of creditors;118 and, in larger \ncases, monthly operating reports reflecting sources and uses of cash and other \nassets.119 Professionals must disclose any \u201cconnections\u201d to parties in interest, \nincluding potential conflicts of interest.120 Every important matter in the case \n \n 113.

As discussed below, the United States Trustee is considered the \u201cwatchdog\u201d of the \nBankruptcy System, though one that is distinctly unpopular with both practitioners \nand judges.

For the vast majority of chapter 11 \ncases, no trustee is appointed.124 Instead, chapter 11 authorizes the intermediate \nstep of appointing an examiner if this is in the parties\u2019 interest or the company \nhas more than $5 million of debt and a party asks for an examiner.125 In cases \nof \u201cgreat public interest\u201d involving fraud or wrongdoing, the drafters of \nchapter 11 envisioned that an examiner would provide \u201cspecial protection\u201d by \ninvestigating and reporting on the causes and consequences of the debtor\u2019s \nfailure while permitting current management to remain in control of the \ndebtor.126 Examiners have featured prominently in such notorious cases as \nEnron and Lehman Brothers.127 The question whether to appoint an examiner \nwould prove to be a pivotal issue in FTX. \nE. The Lawyers\u2019 Role in Chapter 11 \nIn the years between the 1938 Chandler Act and the passage of the 1978 \nBankruptcy Code, large law firms like S&C exited corporate reorganization \npractice due to the prohibition on lawyers or bankers that had represented the \ndebtor or its investment bank before bankruptcy serving as advisors in \nbankruptcy.128 Because the new chapter 11 allowed the debtor\u2019s managers to \n \n 121.

Large \ncorporations that fell into financial distress did not use the lawyers that had \npreviously represented the company as their bankruptcy lawyers. Instead, the \ncompany would hire new bankruptcy specialists. The new model avoided the \nconflicts of interest that had arisen in the receivership era, thus preserving this \nfeature of the New Deal reformers\u2019 commitment to system integrity. \nThere were occasionally problematic exceptions. One involved Leslie Fay, \na company whose bankruptcy was triggered by an accounting scandal.130 Weil \nGotshal had worked for Leslie Fay\u2019s audit committee before Leslie Fay filed for \nbankruptcy.131 In its application for retention as the company\u2019s bankruptcy \nattorneys, Weil noted that it represented the audit committee but failed to \ndisclose its substantial relationships with two Leslie Fay directors and an \nauditor who were potential subjects of the investigation.132 Although the \nbankruptcy judge did not disqualify Weil Gotshal, given the potential \ndisruption to the case, she ordered the firm to pay the costs incurred by an \nexaminer and other direct and indirect costs of the undisclosed conflicts.133 \nAnother exception involved a Wisconsin mining-tool manufacturer called \nBucyrus-Erie that had gone through a leveraged buyout (LBO) and later filed \nfor bankruptcy.134 John Gellene, a young partner at Milbank Tweed, the \ndebtor\u2019s bankruptcy lawyer, did not press to challenge the LBO as a fraudulent \nconveyance, contending that the statute of limitations had expired.135 Late in \nthe case, a creditor who was unhappy with the proposed reorganization \ndiscovered that Milbank had also represented the principal lender in other \nmatters and that Gellene had failed to disclose that connection as required by \nthe bankruptcy rules.136 The creditor sought disgorgement of Milbank\u2019s fees \n \n 129.

FTX and Crypto Credibility \nFTX was a complex of over one hundred related entities which appear to \nhave had three main lines of business: two cryptocurrency exchanges and a \nhedge fund. According to the company\u2019s chapter 11 disclosure statement, one of \nthe two exchanges was based in the U.S. (FTX US), and the other conducted \nbusiness internationally (FTX International, owned by FTX Trading, Ltd).144 \nFTX US\u2014by far the smaller of the two, but a basis for FTX\u2019s chapter 11 filing \nin the United States\u2014was \u201can exchange for spot trading in digital assets and \ntokens\u201d; FTX International was \u201ca digital asset trading platform and \nexchange.\u201d145 \nFTX\u2019s exchanges \u201cwere among the world\u2019s largest digital asset exchanges, \nwhere millions of customers bought, sold and traded certain digital assets.\u201d146 \nThe exchanges \u201cgained international prominence for their popularity among \nusers, their high-profile acquisitions and celebrity endorsements, and the \npublic image of Samuel Bankman-Fried, their co-founder and CEO, who was a \nvocal public figure in the cryptocurrency industry.\u201d147 \nThe hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC (\u201cAlameda\u201d)\u2014a name Bankman-\nFried chose because it did not conjure up images of risky trading148\u2014predated \nthe exchanges. It was Bankman-Fried\u2019s first foray into crypto. He and a band of \nfellow \u201ceffective altruists\u201d (his preferred utilitarian philosophy149) sought to \nexploit mismatches in crypto prices around the world. Most of his early \npartners rebelled and left before the hedge fund surged into profitability.150 As \n \n144.

At Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal trial, his defense counsel explained the accounts as \nfollows: \n[I]nfo@Alameda was the trading account that Alameda had on the FTX exchange where it was \ntrading for its own account. If you look at the visibility on the admin user dashboard at the \nbottom, when Sam was the CEO of FTX, no longer running Alameda, he would use that \nadmin dashboard, as others would, to check accounts of all customers, including Alameda, and \nwhat he could see was what was in the info@Alameda account, the trading account. On the \nleft-hand side is the FTX\u2014fiat@FTX.com account. That was very different. It was a tracking \nfootnote continued on next page \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN. L. REV. 369 (2025) \n396 \ncreated the means by which Bankman-Fried and other FTX insiders were able \nto misappropriate customer funds.158 \nAccording to Ellison\u2019s trial testimony, \u201cinfo@\u201d \u201cwas our main account for \ntrading on FTX.\u201d159 This was a ledger entry (not a bank account) through \nwhich assets held by Alameda could be traded through the FTX International \nexchange.160 The account exempted Alameda from a rule on the exchange that \nrequired the automatic liquidation of any account that had a negative value.161 \nUnlike other customers on the exchange, Alameda could effectively borrow \nbillions of dollars from the exchange.162 \nThis would not necessarily have been a problem, but for the fact that \nAlameda was actually borrowing billions of dollars in customer assets through \nthe fiat@ account.163 That account was, according to Bankman-Fried, created \nas a payment processor because Alameda (the hedge fund) could get a bank \naccount but FTX International (the crypto exchange) could not.164 Customers \nwould send assets (fiat or digital) to fiat@ thinking those assets were going to \n \naccount. It was supposed to track FTX customer deposits and withdrawals of fiat or dollar, \ncurrency, so forth, via Alameda bank accounts, and it wasn\u2019t visible from the admin user \ndashboard. \n \n Hearing Transcript, Nov. 1, 2023 at 3060, United States v.

What are some of the ways that Alameda was able to steal customer money? \nA. We had access to an essentially unlimited line of credit on FTX, and we received FTX \ncustomer funds directly into our bank accounts as part of the FTX fiat deposit system. \nQ.

As the Wall Street Journal explained: \nCourt filings have revealed a line buried deep in FTX\u2019s code that allowed Alameda to have a \nnegative balance of as much as $65 billion on the exchange. \nNormal users couldn\u2019t go negative on FTX. They were subject to an automatic liquidation \nprocess, in which FTX sold off their assets if their balances fell below zero.

Ellison testified that \u201conce [Alameda] started borrowing in the billions of dollars, I \nknew that our borrowing exceeded the total amount of money that FTX had from its \nrevenue and from its fundraising so I knew that some of what we were borrowing at \nleast had to be customer funds.\u201d Ellison Hearing Transcript 1, supra note 155, at 662. \n 163. See, e.g., LEWIS, supra note 17, at 219-20. \n 164. See, e.g., id. \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN. L. REV. 369 (2025) \n397 \nremain theirs to trade on FTX, which Bankman-Fried claims was what was \nsupposed to happen. Legally, however, it did not. Instead, the assets were held \nand ultimately used by Alameda. According to a statement that Bankman-Fried \nshared with us during an interview: \nThe fiat@ledger and Alameda\u2019s bank accounts at Silvergate Bank (hereinafter, \njointly, the \u201cfiat@ account\u201d) were created to serve as a payment processor for \nFTX, at a time when FTX could not obtain a bank account of its own, and hence \ncould not process customers\u2019 fiat deposits and withdrawals directly. As a \nworkaround until it could obtain its own bank account, FTX used Alameda\u2019s \naccounts at Silvergate to receive and disburse customers\u2019 fiat deposits and \nwithdrawals. All of the transactions were tracked on the fiat@ledger, which \nautomatically credited and debited customers\u2019 accounts on FTX to reflect the \ntransfers of fiat.  \nOnce FTX obtained its own bank accounts in late 2021 and the spring of 2022, the \nportal on its website re-routed customers directly to its own accounts rather than \nthe fiat@ account. There was, however, a serious problem with the fiat@ account \nhaving nothing to do with the \u201cback door\u201d or auto-liquidation, which was that \nFTX was not carefully tracking the balance in the account. As a result, \nmanagement was unaware of large swings in the balance as they were happening. \nIn the beginning of 2021, Alameda had a slight surplus in the fiat@ account\u2014that \nis, FTX owed Alameda money. In the fall of 2021, Alameda had a negative balance \nof roughly $4 billion in the fiat@ account. As a result of the boom crypto market, \nthe value of the fiat@ account doubled in the last quarter of 2021, reaching a high \npoint of roughly $8 billion in the first two months of 2022. Even with the \nballooning in the fiat@ debt, at the start of 2022, Alameda\u2019s net asset value was \naround $40 billion, which meant FTX faced no serious risk that Alameda would \ndefault on the loan at that point.165 \nAlameda also held a significant position in FTT, the FTX Group\u2019s \u201cnative \ntoken,\u201d which magnified the problem because the token appeared as an asset on \nAlameda\u2019s balance sheet but was effectively exposed to correlated risk.166 FTT \nprovided discounted access to the exchange and was a cross between a rewards \nprogram and equity that could be bought or sold, since holders were entitled to \n \n 165. See Telephone Interview with Sam Bankman-Fried (Jan. 27, 2025) (transcript on file \nwith authors). Putting claims about Alameda\u2019s finanancial condition to one side, it \nappears that this is consistent with the government\u2019s version of the story. The SEC \ncomplaint against Bankman-Fried, for example, recites that \u201c[t]his multi-billion-dollar \nliability was reflected in an internal account in the FTX database that was not tied to \nAlameda but was instead called \u2018fiat@ftx.com.\u2019 Characterizing the amount of customer \nfunds sent to Alameda as an internal FTX account had the effect of concealing \nAlameda\u2019s liability in FTX\u2019s internal systems.\u201d See Complaint \u00b6 37, SEC v.

The Binance problem (part 1) \nWhile many things went wrong at FTX, it appears that the company\u2019s \nmain crypto competitor, Binance, the largest centralized digital asset exchange, \ncontributed significantly to its demise in three ways. \nFirst, in July 2021, FTX repurchased from Binance 96 million shares of \nSeries A Preferred Stock of FTX Trading for over $2 billion ($1.2 billion in \ncash, the balance in tokens).172 It appears that some, if not all, of this purchase \nwas made with customer assets held by Alameda.173 While it appears that FTX \nwas not insolvent or illiquid at the time, it may have left FTX \nundercapitalized.174 The government would later point to this transaction as a \nmain reason Bankman-Fried committed crimes.175 As explained in Part V, it \n \n 167.

See Letter from Colin D. Lloyd, Partner, Sullivan & Cromwell, to Clark Hutchison, \nDirector, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, (Nov. 11, 2022) (on file with \nauthors) [hereinafter CFTC Withdrawal Letter]. Dietderich\u2019s first supplement to the \nS&C retention application indicates that the firm\u2019s work in this regard was performed \nfor West Realm Shires, Inc. (\u201cWRS\u201d). See Dietderich 1st Supp., supra note 26, \u00b6\u00b6 48-50. \nAccording to the Approved Disclosure Statement, it appears that WRS was the direct \nor indirect parent of LedgerX and the other entities in the FTX US group.

Examiner Report, supra note 41, at 28-29. The Examiner\u2019s Report provides as follows: \nS&C also represented WRS in its formal request to the CFTC to modify WRS\u2019 registration as \na derivative clearing organization so it could offer margined products directly to participants. \nS&C was paid approximately $662,000 for this representation. And S&C advised the FTX \nGroup in connection with other investigations and inquiries from the CFTC. One involved \ninquiries concerning third-party crypto businesses, for which S&C received approximately \n$220,000. There was one CFTC matter for which S&C received fees in excess of $1,000,000, \nwhich was in connection with the agency\u2019s investigation into the FTX Group\u2019s Know Your \nCustomer policies and procedures, for which S&C received $1,405,000. \n \n Id.

This email was indexed in the \nBankman-Fried criminal prosecution as FTX 001547691; SDNY 06_00785552. It is not \nclear whether this filing was a supplement to the initial application filed in December \n2021 or a new application. \n 207.

This email was reproduced in the CFTC Transmittal Email, note 206 \nabove. \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN. L. REV. 369 (2025) \n404 \nAugust 10, 2022, Scott Sloan, of the CFTC, emailed Lloyd to ask that he and \nFTX answer a series of queries, the first of which was: \u201cPlease explain FTX\u2019s \nand Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s relationship with Alameda Research.\u201d208 Lloyd \nresponded that evening, \u201c[w]e and FTX will review and come back shortly.\u201d209 \nAt some point thereafter, it appears that a lengthy response was sent to the \nCFTC. Part of this response stated that Alameda \u201chas no . . . special or unique \naccess to the exchange, to exchange data, or to any other feature of either \nexchange [international or U.S.], versus that which is available to any other \nprofessional trading participant.\u201d210 \nThis statement was false. The info@ and fiat@ accounts did give Alameda \nspecial access to the FTX exchange, which was a key factor in the Bankman-\nFried prosecution.211 \nS&C\u2019s connection to the statement is not clear. It appears, based on \ndocuments produced in Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal trial, that discussions with \nthe CFTC occurred through S&C partner Lloyd,212 but it is not known who \nprepared or sent this statement. Thus, it is possible that S&C did not know of it \nor play a role in writing it, as S&C lawyers would later assert.213 \nThat seems improbable, however. Lloyd had told the CFTC that \u201c[w]e and \nFTX will review and come back shortly.\u201d214 \u201cWe\u201d almost surely meant S&C. \nMoreover, given S&C\u2019s reputation for excellence in regulatory practice and the \nfact that the firm billed $2 million for this work, it seems more likely that the \nfirm would, or should, have engaged in some verification of the facts \nunderlying the statement. \nNevertheless, the appointed bankruptcy Examiner later accepted S&C\u2019s \nassertions that they did not verify the statement.215 As explained in Part IV.E, \n \n 208. See SBF Sentencing Memorandum, supra note 184, Exhibit J, at 2 (reproducing Email \nfrom Scott Sloan, Special Counsel, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to Colin \nD.

S&C lawyers would assert that they neither \nknew, nor had reason to know, of the fraud at FTX because: \n(1) the work they performed did not entail verifying the factual accuracy of statements made \nby the FTX Group; (2) at the time, they had no reason to question the veracity of the \ninformation they received from the Debtors; and (3) they relied upon the accuracy of these \nrepresentations in rendering their legal advice. \n \n Id.

Examiner Report, supra note 41, at 55-56 (concluding that there was \u201cno evidence to \nsuggest that S&C attorneys knew that any of the Debtors\u2019 submissions to regulators \nfootnote continued on next page \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN. L. REV. 369 (2025) \n405 \nthere are reasons to question the Examiner\u2019s conclusion on this issue. Among \nother limitations, he relied heavily on an investigation of S&C by S&C\u2019s co-\ncounsel in the bankruptcy, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan (Quinn \nEmanuel), who, in turn, apparently confined their investigation to reviewing \ndocuments and interviewing S&C partners.216 The contents of those \ninvestigations were not revealed by the Examiner. \n3. Discovering the linkages and missing red flags? \nTwo incidents that occurred shortly after the CFTC application was filed \nare further reason to believe that S&C\u2019s prebankruptcy work exposed it to the \nunderlying misconduct or created grounds to make further inquiry. \nFirst, it appears that evidence of asset commingling was discovered by \nLedgerX employees in May 2022.217 According to a Wall Street Journal report, \nJulie Schoening, the Chief Risk Officer for LedgerX, \u201craised concerns about her \nteam\u2019s discoveries with her boss, LedgerX head Zach Dexter.\u201d218 Then, in early \nAugust 2022, Schoening was fired.219 According to the Wall Street Journal, \u201c[t]he \ntermination came after some FTX executives circulated a document \ncontaining what were purported to be screenshots of inappropriate messages \nshe had sent to other employees.\u201d220 Although Schoening\u2019s lawyer could not \ncomment due to a settlement agreement with FTX, some at LedgerX said \u201cthe \nmessages were doctored or taken out of context, and suggested that Schoening \nirritated her bosses by identifying problems with FTX\u2019s risk management.\u201d221 \nSecond, the next month, in September 2022, LedgerX affiliate FTX US \nfired its auditor.222 That auditor (identified in the Examiner\u2019s Report as \n\u201cAuditor-1\u201d) had, according to the Examiner, provided \u201cclean audit opinions\u201d \nfor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021.223 But the auditor was fired after \nsubmitting draft reports identifying FTX US\u2019s \u201clack of internal controls as \n\u2018Material Weaknesses\u2019 and \u2018Significant Deficiencies.\u2019\u201d224 \n \ncontained false or misleading statements\u201d and that \u201cS&C was not made aware of any \nfacts that would have revealed to it the fraud at the FTX Group\u201d). \n 216. See Examiner Report, supra note 41, at 36-37. These limitations in the Examiner\u2019s \nReport are discussed in Part IV.E below. \n217.

REV. 369 (2025) \n406 \nTerminating a chief risk officer or an auditor is a significant event.225 \nTerminating both in the space of two months would seem to be even more \nserious. If S&C knew of these events, the firm would have been on inquiry \nnotice that there were problems at FTX. \nIt is possible that FTX hid these events from S&C. Here, however, that \nseems unlikely because internal counsel for these FTX entities was Ryne \nMiller\u2014the former S&C partner.226 It appears more likely that, as general \ncounsel, Miller knew of these events and, given his relationship to S&C, shared \nthe information with S&C. \nIf S&C knew of either event, there is no evidence that S&C took any action \nin response. It is, however, notable that on November 11, 2022\u2014the same day \nFTX commenced its bankruptcy\u2014S&C withdrew FTX\u2019s CFTC licensure \napplication.227 As of this writing, that application is not publicly available, so it \nis not known what it stated about FTX or what role S&C played in its \npreparation. The Examiner\u2019s report does not discuss the application or reveal \nits contents. \nC. Wresting Control from Sam Bankman-Fried \nWe are here to help . . . however we can. \nDuring the bankruptcy case, S&C would characterize Sam Bankman-Fried \nas a liar and indicted intermeddler for tweeting criticisms of how Ray and S&C \nwere handling the case.228 But that is not how they treated him when crisis \n \n 225. See, e.g., Jeffrey N. Gordon, What Enron Means for the Management and Control of the \nModern Business Corporation: Some Initial Reflections, 69 U. CHI. L.

At the hearing on the firm\u2019s retention early in the case, \nS&C partner James Bromley criticized Bankman-Fried\u2019s \u201cvery long and rambling \nfootnote continued on next page \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN. L. REV. 369 (2025) \n407 \nstruck and S&C urged Bankman-Fried to transfer control of the companies to \nRay to commence the bankruptcy.229 Indeed, they assured Bankman-Fried that \nbankruptcy could save the companies\u2014and that he would play an important \nrole in that process. Based on available information, and as discussed in this \nSubpart, S&C did not inform Bankman-Fried that he or other insiders had \ncriminal exposure\u2014or that S&C may have played a role in triggering or \naccelerating that exposure. Quite the opposite: S&C attorneys offered to help \nBankman-Fried \u201cavoid[] legal pitfalls.\u201d230 Based on these assurances, Bankman-\nFried gave up control of FTX to John Ray, who would later use the company\u2019s \nsignificant resources to support Bankman-Fried\u2019s prosecution.231 \n1. Reassuring Sam and \u201creporting out\u201d \nOn November 9, 2022, in the wake of Binance\u2019s decision not to acquire \nFTX, S&C partner Andrew Dietderich sent Bankman-Fried an email at around \n9:30 PM, describing steps needed to \u201crescue\u201d FTX.

First, \nDietderich did not recommend that Ray be appointed as chief executive officer \n(CEO), but instead as chief restructuring officer (CRO), terminable at will.237 A \nCRO is someone who works alongside the CEO, and exerts significant \ninfluence, but who does not displace the CEO.238 This implied that Bankman-\nFried would remain CEO, and Dietderich specified that Bankman-Fried would \nremain a director. This made sense, since Bankman-Fried was \u201cfocused on \nrescue alternatives,\u201d which would include raising new funds to address the \nliquidity crisis presented by the run on deposits.239 Months later, Ray and S&C \nclaimed that Bankman-Fried \u201cresign[ed],\u201d but there is no public evidence that \nhe resigned from any of his positions at the company.240 The absence of \n \n 236. Id. The November 9 Email reads in full as follows: \nSam and Ryne, \nI know company focused [sic] on rescue alternatives at this time and we are here to help \nsupport that however we can. On the safety net, there is a short list we need your decision on \nto keep making progress and have the option ready in case you need it. Even if we go full \nspeed, it usually takes two weeks to be ready in an organized manner. We have that process \nunderway but think it\u2019s important to do a few more things: \n1. Identify someone at FTX.com that can be our point person for information requests. Is \nthat Ryne or is Ryne only in US? There is a lot of information to get ready to pay \nemployees etc. without disruption upon filing. \n2. Appoint Alvarez & Mars[a]l to help us on the accounting for case prep. They work on an \nhourly basis and take a retainer. We have documentation to send you to sign if you are \nokay. \n3. Ideally, appoint a CRO [chief restructuring officer] to be on stand-by as the manager of \nthe company in a possible chapter 11. We recommend Sam stay as a director. The manager \nis there because of conflicts. We have considered candidates and suggest John Ray. Resume \nattached. The CRO works by the hour and can be terminated anytime. We can set up [sic] \nso he does nothing before a decision to file if you prefer. \n4. Identify a chapter 11 communications team, which should be external. They also can be \ncompletely on stand-by for now, but we should know who they are and have them ready to \ngo in case the decision is made. \nThose are the immediate priorities. We\u2019d like to do more, of course, but that\u2019s the core of it for \nnow. Again, no decision is made to file\u2014this is only prep at this time. \nAndy \n \n Id. at 8-9. \n 237.

Mr. Sun and Mr. Miller were \nvisibly distressed and appeared surprised and upset by these developments. After a \ndiscussion, Mr. Sun engaged S&C and Mr. Sun instructed S&C to take steps to \nbegin to prepare FTX International for chapter 11 in the event that a rescue \nfinancing or other transaction was not forthcoming or, if forthcoming, could not \nbe consummated without court supervision.246 \nThis apparently means that Dietderich knew on November 8\u2014one day \nbefore his reassuring email to Bankman-Fried\u2014that FTX was in potentially \nserious trouble. It was, he declared, an \u201cexigent situation.\u201d247 Yet his email to \nBankman-Fried the next day conveyed none of this exigency and, instead, \nassured Bankman-Fried that a bankruptcy filing was likely two weeks away.248 \nS&C may have been telling a different story to government officials, \nhowever.

S&C attorneys in our Criminal Defense & Investigations \nGroup, in consultation with Mr. Miller, reported the concern to federal \nauthorities, including the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern \nDistrict of New York, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission.250 \nIt is, as a preliminary matter, not clear whether Miller or S&C had the \nauthority to report their concerns. While attorneys for an organization such as \nFTX have some discretion in deciding how to proceed when they believe there \nhas been serious misconduct, they must, \u201cif warranted by the seriousness of the \nmatter, refer[] to the highest authority that can act in behalf of the \norganization as determined by applicable law.\u201d251 \nBankman-Fried was the highest authority at FTX, which is presumably \nwhy Dietderich sought his approval, and not Miller\u2019s, to proceed with \npreparation for the chapter 11 filing.252 As such, the New York Rules of \nProfessional Conduct would have had Miller and S&C refer their concerns to \nBankman-Fried.253 Bankman-Fried maintains that he was not informed on \nNovember 9 (or any time until after he had given control to Ray) that Miller \nand S&C had gone to prosecutors.254 \nLegal ethics expert Stephen Gillers has observed that reporting out \nconcerns about organizational misconduct to authorities is a \u201cknotty \nproblem[],\u201d especially when there is a worry that the highest authority in the \norganization may be the culprit.255 \nThe organization\u2019s attorney may bypass that highest authority, and report \nout, if \u201cdespite the lawyer\u2019s efforts . . . the highest authority that can act on \nbehalf of the organization insists upon action, or a refusal to act, that is clearly \nin violation of law and is likely to result in a substantial injury to the \norganization.\u201d256 \n \n249.

REV. 369 (2025) \n411 \nAn influential report from the American Bar Association has stated that \nthe decision to \u201creport out\u201d should be limited to \u201ccircumstances where the \nwrongdoing is clear, the injury to the client organization is substantial, and \ndisclosure would clearly be in the interest of the entity client.\u201d257 The lawyer \nwho reports out \u201cmust have a heightened level of certainty as to the violation \nof law, and the actual or threatened violation must be \u2018clear.\u2019\u201d258 \nGiven the exigent circumstances at the time, it is unclear how Miller or \nS&C could have known with \u201ccertainty\u201d (heightened or otherwise) that \nBankman-Fried or other senior officers at FTX were \u201cinsist[ing] upon action\u201d \nthat was both illegal and \u201clikely to result in substantial injury\u201d to FTX, as \nrequired by New York\u2019s rules of professional conduct.259 Recall that only two \ndays earlier, on November 7, Dietderich had stated that FTX was \u201crock \nsolid.\u201d260 In hindsight, the criminal verdict against Bankman-Fried evidences \nthat Bankman-Fried violated law in ways that hurt FTX and its customers. \nBut, in the moment, S&C could not have known this outcome and, as discussed \nbelow, S&C and FTX appear to have played an important role in supporting, \nand possibly distorting, that prosecution.261 \nBecause they knew that Bankman-Fried was the highest authority at FTX, \nMiller and S&C may have worried that telling him they reported out would \nfurther harm FTX, if they believed he was the culprit. Miller and S&C \nreported their concerns to prosecutors on November 9, 2022.262 Dietderich\u2019s \nNovember 9 Email was sent around 9:30 PM that evening, which would seem \nto be after the concerns had been reported.263 To have reported out, Miller and \nS&C would have to have known with certainty that there was serious \nmisconduct at FTX. \nIf so, however, it is unclear how Dietderich could then assure Bankman-\nFried later that evening that he would have a continuing role in the rescue of \nFTX. That is, it is unclear how S&C could know with requisite certainty that \nFTX, under Bankman-Fried, was engaged in serious misconduct, yet also \nreassure Bankman-Fried that he would remain central to the company\u2019s rescue, \nas both a director and (by inference) its CEO. In the moment, both could not be \ntrue. \n \n 257. See James H. Cheek, III et al., Report of the American Bar Association Task Force on \nCorporate Responsibility, 59 BUS.

It appears that on the \nsame day, they also caused FTX to enter into an agreement with prosecutors to \nvoluntarily produce documents, seemingly again without telling Bankman-\nFried.264 Indeed, S&C\u2019s transmittal letter did not copy Bankman-Fried.265 The \ninitial production occurred by November 15, 2022 and included financial \nstatements, general ledgers, and employee contact information; S&C also \ncaused FTX to agree to voluntarily disclose confidential information on a \n\u201crolling basis.\u201d266  \nYet S&C continued to reassure Bankman-Fried that they were there to \nhelp, and that Bankman-Fried would play a role in the reorganization. Around \n12:30 PM on November 10, shortly before the first bankruptcy petitions were \nfiled, S&C attorney Mitchell Eitel invited Sam to \u201creach out if we can be \nhelpful in thinking through the structuring of any transaction you are looking \nat.\u201d267 As late as November 13, 2022, S&C partner James McDonald wrote to \nattorney Martin Flumenbaum at Paul Weiss, who was briefly Bankman-\nFried\u2019s individual counsel, to say that \u201c[w]e\u2019d be happy to discuss with you any \nideas Sam might have.\u201d268 Since McDonald was also the S&C white-collar \ndefense lawyer\u2014and former Southern District of New York prosecutor\u2014who \nhad just committed FTX to cooperating with prosecutors, it is not clear what \n\u201cideas\u201d of Bankman-Fried\u2019s he would have been \u201chappy to discuss.\u201d269 \nIt is important to be clear that there may be more to the story than we \nknow. Although Bankman-Fried asserts that he did not know that Miller and \nS&C had reported to prosecutors,270 he may in fact have been told and \nforgotten in the chaos of the moment.

The Examiner reports no such evidence, \nimplying that it does not exist. Indeed, as discussed below, S&C\u2019s initial \nresistance to the Examiner\u2019s appointment suggests that they may have sought \nto suppress evidence about their conduct before and at the commencement of \nthe case.273 \nIt is equally important to note that, even if Miller and S&C hid the \nreporting from Bankman-Fried and his lawyers, they may have caused no \nharm in doing so. Prosecutors may already have commenced an investigation \ninto FTX and Bankman-Fried by November 9, 2022, in which case S&C\u2019s \nactions may have done little damage to him and may have helped to prevent \ngreater harm to the company.274 \nUnfortunately, the Examiner\u2019s Report engaged none of the evidence \nabove. Instead, the Examiner noted that he \u201chas not seen any email or other \ndocument in which S&C expressly disclosed a crime to prosecutors or \nregulators prepetition.\u201d275 This may be true, but it is inconsequential. The \nimportant question was not what was documented, but what Miller and S&C told \n \n 271. See Examiner Report, supra note 41, at 52. The authors sought an interview with Paul \nWeiss attorneys Ken Ziman and Martin Flumenbaum. They never responded to the \nrequest. \n272. The closest we have seen is a message dated November 9, 2022 from Ryne Miller\u2014not \nS&C\u2014to a group including Bankman-Fried saying: \nBased on what we are learning . . . and based on advice of Sullivan & Cromwell, our \nrecommendation and instruction (I am GC of FTX US so saying what I can) is to turn off \ntrading and halt activity on both FTX US and FTX.com. And then identify a control/decision \nperson to work with outside counsel on next steps.

The Examiner apparently interviewed prosecutors but reported \nneither what he asked nor what they said.276 \nThe Examiner seemed to think that Miller authorized whatever reporting \noccurred, and this made the reporting permissible.277 But that begs the question \nwhether Miller had authority to make such an authorization. As explained \nabove, he was not the highest authority in the organization, or even the top-\nlevel general counsel (that was chief legal officer Dan Friedberg).278 Instead, \nMiller was general counsel for FTX US. As a fallback, the Examiner excused \nS&C on grounds that Bankman-Fried had his own counsel by this point.279 But \nthat is irrelevant to the question of authority and, if they did not know that \nS&C and Miller had gone to prosecutors, then they would have been as duped \nas Bankman-Fried claims to have been.280 As further explained in Part IV.E, \nthis is one of several unfortunate limitations in the examination that \nultimately occurred. \n \n 276.

The Examiner \ncriticized an earlier draft of this paper for \u201cconflat[ing]\u201d \u201ca corporate client and its \nprincipals.\u201d Id. To be clear, we never stated that S&C was acting as Bankman-Fried\u2019s \ncounsel for these purposes. We recognized then, and now, that Bankman-Fried had his \nown counsel, but we think that is not relevant if they were as uninformed about this as \nBankman-Fried. In any case, FTX appears not to have observed corporate formalities, \nso it is unclear why this formal distinction would have mattered as the company \ncollapsed into bankruptcy. The Examiner\u2019s Phase II Report later indicated that S&C \nitself ignored corporate formalities when it represented both Bankman-Fried and \nFTX, though it seemed to think it irrelevant to questions of S&C\u2019s professional \nresponsibilities. See Examiner Phase II Report, supra note 41, at 16 (\u201c[S&C] knew that \nthe FTX Group was largely owned by Bankman-Fried, and that it is common for \nwealthy individuals to rely on their corporate employees in this manner.\u201d). \n280. A more useful question the Examiner might have asked was: Why did Bankman-Fried \nnot object to S&C\u2019s retention or, at minimum, file an ethics grievance with appropriate \nbar authorities? When we asked that question, a representative said that it was because \nof \u201ceverything else going on,\u201d which we interpret to mean Bankman-Fried\u2019s focus on \ndefending the criminal prosecution.

S&C also substantially changed \nBankman-Fried\u2019s role in FTX at the last minute, so that he would give up all \ncontrol to Ray\u2014not simply appoint him as CRO. \nOn November 10, 2022, the crisis at FTX took a new turn when \ninvoluntary insolvency proceedings were commenced against the Australian \nsubsidiary.281 When he learned of this, Miller advised that the exchanges \nshould be \u201chalted immediately,\u201d and that he was \u201cexploring ways to change \ncontrol in order to authorize a proper insolvency process.\u201d282 This was because \n\u201cthe founding team is not currently in a cooperative posture.\u201d283 \nAt around 8:00 PM that day, it appears that Dietderich sent to Bankman-\nFried\u2019s personal counsel, Paul Weiss (but not Bankman-Fried), a draft \ndocument titled \u201cOmnibus Corporate Authority\u201d (OCA).284 It is not clear what \nthat version of the OCA said. Initially, Dietderich agreed that Paul Weiss \nshould hold the OCA in escrow after Bankman-Fried executed it.285 Although \nDietderich recognized that a \u201cmore fulsome approach\u201d might be needed later, \n\u201cthis at least sets up what we need in an emergency.\u201d286 \nThat emergency was only hours away. At around 12:30 AM that night, \nPaul Weiss attorney Martin Flumenbaum (acting as Bankman-Fried\u2019s personal \ncounsel) responded to Dietderich\u2019s email with the OCA by saying that \nBankman-Fried \u201cwould prefer . . . to sign the document without Ray\u2019s name in \nit for us to hold in escrow\u201d because they wanted to \u201ccheck with a couple more \ncontacts concerning Ray\u201d as well as \u201cother potential restructuring \n \n281.

Nothing would have precluded \nhim from doing so as a legal matter, and Dietderich\u2019s email failed to explain the \nchange. Nor is it apparent from this email what had changed to create this new \nsense of urgency. It may have been concern that foreign insolvency \nproceedings would be commenced. This might have led to multiple \nsimultaneous proceedings around the world, but it is not clear how or why \nthat would \u201cresult in substantial investor losses,\u201d as Dietderich wrote.296 \nLater, Bankman-Fried would claim that he was \u201cput under extreme \npressure to file for Chapter 11\u201d by S&C and its alumnus, Miller, to sign the \nOCA.297 Despite the \u201cURGENT\u201d subject line, Dietderich later categorically \ndenied doing so.298 \nAt around 4:30 AM, Bankman-Fried executed the OCA that S&C had \nprepared.299 Under it he would: \nauthorize, instruct and consent to . . . the appointment of John J. Ray III (the \n\u201cCEO\u201d) as Chief Executive Officer with plenary authority to exercise all powers \nand authority capable of delegation to an officer under applicable law, including \nwithout limitation in connection with a voluntary filing for protection from \ncreditors under Title 11 of the United States Code.300  \nFor all practical purposes, it gave Ray control of FTX, its data and its \nbillions of dollars in assets, all of which Ray could use in his discretion, \nincluding to support the Bankman-Fried prosecution. It sealed Bankman-\nFried\u2019s fate. \nIII. Foxes and Henhouses: S&C\u2019s Retention and the Bankman-Fried \nTrial \nIn most bankruptcy cases, the choice of bankruptcy attorneys is \nuncontroversial.

The Retention of S&C as FTX\u2019s Bankruptcy Lawyers \nAs noted earlier, chapter 11 counsel ordinarily has little or no significant \nhistory with the corporate debtor.302 This is due in part to special ethics rules \nimposed by the Bankruptcy Code. Section 327(a) of the Bankruptcy Code \nauthorizes the debtor-in-possession, with court approval, to employ \nprofessionals, including lawyers, if the professionals (1) \u201cdo not hold or \nrepresent an interest adverse to the estate\u201d and are (2) \u201cdisinterested persons.\u201d303 \nThe latter are defined, in relevant part, as those who do \u201cnot have an interest \nmaterially adverse to the interest of the estate or of any class of creditors or \nequity security holders, by reason of any direct or indirect relationship to, \nconnection with, or interest in, the debtor, or for any other reason.\u201d304 \nA claim that the bankruptcy estate has against the lawyers would be an \n\u201cadverse interest.\u201d305 Assessing the work of prebankruptcy gatekeepers, to \ndetermine whether malpractice contributed to the debtor\u2019s collapse, is a key \nfunction of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy lawyers. Assurance that the bankruptcy \nlawyers had no role in prebankruptcy misbehavior is especially important if \nthe likelihood of misbehavior is high, as in cases where fraud contributed to \nthe company\u2019s failure. In Enron, for example, prebankruptcy counsel were not \n \n 302. See supra Part I.E. \n303. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(a); see In re BH&P Inc., 949 F.2d 1300, 1314 (3d Cir. 1991). In addition to \nSection 327(a), Section 327(e) can be read as a blanket prohibition against pre-distress \ncounsel serving as the debtor\u2019s principal bankruptcy counsel, but this interpretation is \nunsettled. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(e) (\u201cThe trustee, with the court\u2019s approval, may employ, \nfor a specified special purpose, other than to represent the trustee in conducting the \ncase, an attorney that has represented the debt or, if in the best interest of the estate, \nand if such attorney does not represent or hold any in terest adverse to the debtor or to \nthe estate with respect to the matter on which such attorney is to be employed.\u201d). \n304. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14)(C). \n 305. See, e.g., BH&P, 949 F.2d at 1308 (noting that the definition of \u201cdisinterested person\u201d \nunder \u00a7 327(a) \u201chas been held \u2018broad enough to include anyone who in the slightest \ndegree might have some interest or relationship that would even faintly color the \nindependence and impartial attitude required by the Code and the Bankruptcy Rules.\u2019\u201d \n(quoting In re BH&P, Inc., 119 B.R. 35, 42 (D.N.J. 1990))). The logic seems to be that the \nmalpractice cause of action is property of the estate, which the trustee can pursue \nagainst the negligent lawyer. This is at minimum consistent with the more general \nview that causes of action can become property of the bankruptcy estate. See Polis v. \nGetaways, Inc. (In re Polis), 217 F.3d 899, 901 (7th Cir. 2000). \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN. L. REV. 369 (2025) \n419 \nretained in the bankruptcy.306 Nor should they have been, as it turned out the \nestate had malpractice claims against some of the prebankruptcy lawyers, \ngiven their role in Enron\u2019s misconduct.307 \nIn FTX, S&C\u2019s original retention application had only three sentences on \nits prebankruptcy work.308 It did not describe the type of regulatory and \ntransactional work that S&C had performed for FTX. Nor did it disclose that a \nformer S&C partner, Ryne Miller, was the general counsel at FTX US, and that \nother S&C alumni also worked at FTX.309 Nor that S&C had also worked for \ncertain FTX founders (e.g., Bankman-Fried) personally. A judge or other \nobserver who read quickly might easily imagine that S&C\u2019s role was similar to \nthe prebankruptcy role that lawyers play in other major cases, helping to \nprepare for the bankruptcy but having no earlier involvement. \nWere it not for S&C\u2019s earlier involvement, the firm would be highly \nqualified to represent the FTX debtors. As John Ray put it in his affidavit, S&C \nhad expertise in \u201call of the key practice areas\u201d likely to matter in the case, \nincluding financial services regulation, civil and criminal investigations, \ncybercrime, international money laundering, and sanctions compliance.310 \nNotably, in the list of services S&C would perform, Dietderich listed as second \n(behind advising the debtors on their powers and duties in that capacity) \n\u201cadvising the Debtors with respect to responses and discussions with local and \n \n306.

The \nU.S. Trustee asserted two overarching concerns. First, S&C had failed to \nadequately disclose its connections to FTX and its prebankruptcy insiders, as \nrequired by the Bankruptcy Code.312 This mattered because \u201cpublicly available \ninformation thus far raises the specter that S&C may have a conflict or not be \ndisinterested given that an S&C partner of eight years became general counsel \nfor certain of the Debtors approximately 14 months before the petition \ndate.\u201d313 \nSecond, S&C sought to oversee the internal investigation into the debtor\u2019s \ncollapse which, the U.S. Trustee argued, was forbidden by the Bankruptcy \nCode.314 Under the Code, \u201conly bankruptcy trustees and examiners . . . , not \ndebtors-in-possession, have authority to investigate \u2018the acts, conduct, assets, \nliabilities, and financial condition of the debtor.\u2019\u201d315 Section 1107(a) permits \ndebtors-in-possession to exercise most trustee powers\u2014but not that one. This \nwas, according to the U.S. Trustee, \u201cintentional\u201d to preserve the integrity of the \nreorganization process.316 \nS&C apparently settled the Trustee\u2019s objections and cured some of the \ndisclosure failures shortly before the hearing on their retention by filing \nsupplemental affidavits, discussed further below.317 On January 17, 2023, less \nthan seventy-two hours before the hearing on S&C\u2019s retention, Dietderich \nsubmitted the first of two supplemental declarations in support of S&C\u2019s \nretention.318 That declaration set out thirty-four pages of additional \ndisclosures and exhibits relating to S&C\u2019s connections with the debtors, \nrevealing for the first time virtually everything publicly known about S&C\u2019s \nconnections to FTX before bankruptcy.319 \n \n311.

REV. 369 (2025) \n421 \nS&C\u2019s interactions with the U.S. Trustee reflect a delay tactic they would \ndeploy elsewhere in the case.320 An affidavit submitted by S&C partner Alexa \nKranzley on the same date Dietderich submitted his supplemental affidavit \nshowed that the U.S. Trustee struggled to get S&C to provide additional \ndisclosures about the nature and scope of its work for several weeks before \nultimately filing its objection.321 By the time Dietderich\u2019s supplemental \naffidavit was filed, few observers would have had the time or sophistication to \nask further questions about the nature of S&C\u2019s work or how Ray came to be \nCEO. \nNevertheless, customers continued to challenge FTX\u2019s request to retain the \nfirm. One customer, Warren Winter, argued that S&C\u2019s retention was \u201cthe \nmost flagrant attempt by a fox to guard a henhouse in recent memory.\u201d322 S&C \nwas, Winter argued, \u201cnot only an inappropriate candidate for appointment as \nthe FTX Group\u2019s bankruptcy counsel\u2014it is a target for investigation with its \nown potential liability. Its appointment as counsel would endanger the estate \nand create a rigged game, undermining creditors\u2019 and the public\u2019s faith in the \nbankruptcy process.\u201d323 But this objection offered few specifics. \nThe bankruptcy court held a hearing on the retention application on \nJanuary 20, 2023.324 Winter sought to delay the hearing on the firm\u2019s retention \nbecause, shortly before the hearing, Dan Friedberg, FTX\u2019s former general \ncounsel, filed a statement which contained allegations that were \u201cas relevant as \n \nfor a firm, with the resources available to Sullivan & Cromwell, to wait until less then \n[sic] 72 hours before the hearing on its application to make any substantive disclosures \nabout its prepetition work for the debtors, and crucial disclosures concerning its own \nformer partner\u2019s employment as one of the top legal officers of the FTX Group.\u201d Id. \n320.

Mr. \nFriedberg, Bromley said, \u201chas got a checkered past. It takes a lot of guts for him \nto put something in writing that says I was the chief compliance officer at \nFTX.\u201d329 The individuals \u201cwho were at, and running, and making the decisions \nthat have brought this company to its knees are rightly concerned that the \ninformation that is being provided to authorities could lead back to their \ndoorstep.\u201d330 Insiders such as Friedberg, Bromley argued, \u201ccan\u2019t throw stones at \nthe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, but they can throw stones at debtor\u2019s counsel that is \nproviding information to the prosecutors and the regulators; that is exactly \nwhat is happening.\u201d331 Bromley\u2019s suggestion that S&C was a vital resource for \nthe prosecutors who had indicted Sam Bankman-Fried, and that the firm was \nfurthering the public interest in policing fraud, would become a theme in the \nFTX bankruptcy. Friedberg would later be one of the few lawyers FTX sued \nfor malpractice.332 \nThe court concluded that it would pay no attention to the Friedberg \nstatement, acquiescing to S&C\u2019s argument that \u201cit\u2019s a rambling declaration,\u201d and \nthat \u201cMr. Frie[d]berg is not here\u201d in the courtroom.333 \n \n 325.

It is important to understand the complications this \ncreated. \nThe indictment, prosecution, and trial of Bankman-Fried all took place in \nless than a year, which one expert described as \u201cthe prosecutorial equivalent of \nbreaking the sound barrier.\u201d348 It began on December 9, 2022, with an eight-\ncount indictment, which alleged \u201ca wide-ranging fraud on FTX\u2019s customers \nand investors and on Alameda\u2019s lenders\u201d349 and ended with a jury verdict \nagainst him less than a year later, on November 2, 2023.350 \nThe swift verdict reflected the overwhelming evidence that prosecutors \nmarshaled against Bankman-Fried, including \u201c4.3 terabytes of data [and] more \nthan 1.4 million documents.\u201d351 It appears that much of this material came \nfrom FTX, courtesy of CEO John Ray and the work of S&C.352 Bankman-Fried \nhad alleged in his criminal prosecution that \u201c[t]he Government has effectively \ndeputized Mr. Ray, the FTX Debtors, and their counsel as federal agents to \n \n346.

The Battle Over an Examiner \nThe most obvious corrective to the distortions created by S&C\u2019s role as \nFTX\u2019s bankruptcy lawyers would have been to appoint an examiner at the \noutset of the case. An examiner who did not have ties to S&C or their designee, \nRay, could identify and objectively assess the severity of any conflicts of \ninterest and whether the estate should take action. That an examiner was not \nappointed for nearly a year and a half in FTX\u2014and produced a problematic \nreport\u2014shows how important it is that an examiner be appointed early, \nespecially in large freefall cases like FTX. \nA. Chapter 11 Examiners \nSection 1104(c) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that the bankruptcy \ncourt \u201cshall order\u201d the appointment of an examiner \u201cto conduct such an \ninvestigation of the debtor as is appropriate, including an investigation of any \nallegations of fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct, mismanagement, \nor irregularity in the management of the affairs of the debtor of or by current \nor former management of the debtor.\u201d359 It authorizes that appointment in two \ncircumstances: where \u201c(1) such appointment is in the interests of creditors, any \nequity security holders, and other interests of the estate; or (2) the debtor\u2019s \nfixed, liquidated, unsecured debts, other than debts for goods, services, or \ntaxes,\u201d exceed $5 million.360 \nDespite the statutory language\u2014\u201cshall\u201d usually means \u201cmust,\u201d as the Third \nCircuit later said361\u2014judges bridle at being told they must appoint an examiner \nwhen they question the value.362 Thus, some do not, despite the statute.363 \n \nQ. If the examiner needs documents, for example, that the debtors have would you provide \nthose documents to the examiner? \nA. I think there might be some caveats to that but, yes. \nQ. Are there other things that you would not provide to the examiner if he or she asked? \n \n Examiner Hearing Transcript, supra note 307, at 71-72.

In a sample of 1,225 cases from 1991 to \n2010, examiners \u201cwere sought in only 104 (8.5% of) cases, and appointed in 48, \nfewer than half of cases where requested, and less than 4% of the sample.\u201d366 \nEven in the 661 large cases in the sample\u2014where appointment would likely \nhave been mandatory given the $5 million threshold\u2014\u201cthey were sought in \nonly ninety-three (14% of) cases, and appointed less than half the time sought, \nin forty-three (or 6.5% of) large cases.\u201d367 \nSecond, courts and parties worry about cost. The examiners in Enron \nfamously cost about $100 million, mostly in legal fees paid as a first-priority \nexpense of administration.368 The cost of an examiner can be difficult to justify \nwhen a company has limited cash flow and the parties view themselves as \ncapable of performing the same functions as an examiner.369 \nAlthough creditors chiefly bear these costs, estate professionals may also \nresist examiner appointments to avoid losing work.

In principle, \nhe should focus on maximizing creditor recoveries.389 But he might also have \nan interest in shielding S&C from investigation\u2014after all, they recruited \nhim.390 Even in the absence of such problems, neither S&C nor Ray would \nordinarily ever get to select the examiner. That would be the job of the U.S. \nTrustee, if an appointment were approved.391 \n2. The appeal \nAfter Judge Dorsey denied the request, the U.S. Trustee took a direct \nappeal to the Third Circuit.392 The arguments before the Third Circuit panel \nwere lopsided. The panel viewed the lower court\u2019s decision not to appoint an \nexaminer as clearly mistaken, for two reasons. \n \n386. Hearing Transcript, Feb. 15, 2023 at 9, In re FTX Trading, Ltd., No. 22-11068 (Bankr. D. \nDel. Feb. 16, 2023), ECF No. 737 (\u201cThere is no question that an examiner or a Chapter 11 \nTrustee, for that matter, appointed pursuant to Section 1104 would have the same \nattributes as Mr. Ray and the independent directors.\u201d) [hereinafter Examiner Ruling \nTranscript]. \n 387. Id. at 9. \n 388. Id. at 10. \n389. As we discuss in Parts IV.D and V, below, there is considerable evidence that Ray has \nfailed to maximize value, including by his resistance to early financing proposals that \nmight have restarted the exchanges, problematic asset sales, and of course the \nsignificant \u201cburn rate\u201d in professional fees incurred in the case. \n 390. See supra Part II.C. \n391. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(d) (\u201c[T]he United States trustee, after consultation with parties in \ninterest, shall appoint, subject to the court\u2019s approval, one disinterested person other \nthan the United States trustee to serve as trustee or examiner, as the case may be, in the \ncase.\u201d). \n 392. In re FTX Trading, Ltd., 91 F.4th 148, 152 (3d Cir. 2024) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(2)). \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN. L. REV. 369 (2025) \n432 \nFirst, the statute obviously requires an examiner; it was a matter of \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d statutory interpretation.393 Second, the mandatory nature of \nthe appointment reflected Congressional intent to protect the public interest. \nThe Third Circuit focused on the importance of investigation by a person who \nis independent and objective. Congress \u201cforbade the examiner from acting as or \nrepresenting a trustee in the bankruptcy and required that the investigation \nremain separate from the reorganization process.\u201d394 Moreover, the examiner \ncould not later act as trustee or counsel to the trustee \u201cin order to ensure that \nexaminers may not profit from the results of their work.\u201d395 Such \n\u201cindependence distinguishes examiners from other participants in the  \nchapter 11 bankruptcies who may investigate wrongdoing but who also seek \nto benefit financially from the reorganization plan.\u201d396 \nAlthough the Third Circuit held that an examiner appointment is \nmandatory if the statutory criteria are satisfied, it did not prescribe the scope of \nthe examination. It did, however, offer some hints. Perhaps foremost was \nconcern about potential conflicts \u201carising from debtor\u2019s counsel serving as pre-\npetition advisors to FTX,\u201d which \u201chave been raised repeatedly.\u201d397 \nC. Conflicts of Public Interests and the FTX Examiner Appointment: \nThe Watchdog That Did Not Bark \nAlthough the Court of Appeals said that S&C\u2019s potential conflicts had been \nraised repeatedly, they had not been raised by the appellant, the U.S. Trustee. \nThis was curious, because the mission of the U.S. Trustee is to preserve the \nintegrity of the system. Indeed, one of the U.S. Trustee\u2019s key roles is \u201cto police \nthe bankruptcy system for conflicts of interest by professionals (lawyers), \n\u2018cronyism,\u2019 or debtor misconduct.\u201d398 \nThe U.S. Trustee\u2019s approach in FTX was more tentative. He initially \nobjected to the S&C retention, noting that \u201cpublicly available information thus \nfar raises the specter that S&C may have a conflict or not be disinterested given \nthat an S&C partner of eight years became general counsel for certain of the \nDebtors approximately 14 months before the petition date.\u201d399 But the U.S. \n \n 393.

REV. 369 (2025) \n433 \nTrustee quickly agreed to settle and withdraw the objection in return for \nadditional disclosure by S&C, which they made at the last minute.400 \nThe U.S. Trustee\u2019s decision to stand down proved consequential. S&C often \nsaid that it was qualified to lead the investigation because it had been found to \nbe disinterested by Judge Dorsey, a finding the Examiner did not disavow.401 In \nthe examiner appeal, the issue of S&C\u2019s potential conflict was asserted not by \nthe Trustee, but instead by a group of law professors (including one of us), who \nsubmitted a brief and argued as amici curiae that the appearance of S&C\u2019s \npotential conflicts, coupled with an unusual degree of secrecy in the case, \npresented significant problems for the chapter 11 case and the integrity of the \nprocess itself.402 \nSurely, the U.S. Trustee understood this. The appearance of S&C\u2019s potential \nconflicts, coupled with their control of the bankruptcy, would be strong \ngrounds for the appointment of an examiner. That would have enabled the \nTrustee to seek a more targeted examination, focused on that cluster of \nquestions, rather than the broader ranging, and potentially more expensive \nand duplicative examination, that Judge Dorsey had rejected. Why not make \nthe argument? \nWe don\u2019t know for sure, but the Trustee\u2019s reticence may have reflected a \ndifferent conflict of interests\u2014between that office and other government \nactors, who might not have wanted an independent examiner.403 Evidence \nfrom S&C fee applications suggests that S&C discussed its response to the \n \n 400. See supra Part III.A. \n401. At oral argument before the Third Circuit, James Bromley of S&C said flatly \u201cthe \nconflict of interest does not exist\u201d: \nJudge Dorsey held an evidentiary hearing with respect to the retention of my law firm . . . . \nBased on that factual determination, Judge Dorsey found that we did not have any issues and \nall of the things that the learned professor just mentioned are res judicata in favor of the estate \nand in favor of my firm. There is not an issue before this Court to look at whether or not \nthere was a conflict of interest, because it has been judicially determined with evidence \nalready. \n \n Transcript of Oral Argument, FTX Trading, Ltd. v. Vara at 26-27, No. 23-2297 (3d Cir. \nNov. 28. 2023), ECF No. 65. S&C made a similar assertion in defense of an FTX investor \nlawsuit against them.

REV. 369 (2025) \n434 \nExaminer motion with prosecutors.404 If, as the evidence suggests, FTX and \nS&C supported the Bankman-Fried prosecution, an independent examination \nmight interfere with that prosecution by raising questions about why S&C was \ndoing so. \nThus, the U.S. Trustee and the U.S. Attorney would represent different, \nand potentially conflicting, facets of the public interest in chapter 11. Here, the \nTrustee may have wanted to vindicate the first\u2014judicial-process integrity\u2014\nwhereas prosecutors sought to advance an important, but different, public \ninterest in prosecuting crimes (the third form of public interest identified in \nthis Article\u2014non-bankruptcy objectives). S&C\u2019s unique position enabled it to \narbitrate between these interests, and to cast itself as the vindicator of the \nversion it preferred. \nIt is not clear how conflicts of this sort within the Department of Justice \nare resolved. We speculate that it may have been the subject of a compromise \nbetween the Trustee and prosecutors: The U.S. Trustee could (and did) seek an \nexaminer, but could not do so in a way that directly threatened the prosecution \nof the prebankruptcy insiders. To accommodate the prosecution, the U.S. \nTrustee would have to refrain from saying anything specifically about S&C\u2019s \nprebankruptcy history with the company, as that might lead to inquiries about \nS&C. \nThe compromise we posit would in all likelihood accomplish two \nimportant goals. First, it would give prosecutors the time and resources to \naggressively pursue the FTX insiders, as they did. Second, it would give the \nTrustee a clean ruling from a highly-regarded appellate court on a key issue\u2014\nthe mandatory nature of examiner appointments. But in the time it would take \nto appeal\u2014the Third Circuit\u2019s decision did not issue until fifteen months after \nthe case was commenced\u2014the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office would continue its high-\nspeed prosecution of Bankman-Fried. \nThe U.S. Trustee is the \u201cwatchdog\u201d of the bankruptcy system. Its failure to \nassert S&C\u2019s potential conflicts as grounds for an examiner, and its potential \ntensions with other government actors, suggest that in FTX it may have been \n \n404. On November 28, 2022, for example, S&C white collar defense partner Steve Peikin \nbilled 8/10ths of an hour for time spent with other S&C attorneys \u201cre: SDNY examiner \nissues.\u201d See First S&C Fee Application, supra note 357, at 345. Since a request for an \nexaminer was made by the U.S. Trustee two days later, and it seems likely that the U.S. \nTrustee had already informally raised the possibility of an examiner with S&C, it \nwould appear that S&C was discussing the implications of an examiner for prosecutors \nin the Southern District of New York. That same day, white collar partner James \nMcDonald, who had initially caused FTX to cooperate with prosecutors, see \nMcDonald Letter, note 264 above, at 30-33, billed half an hour for a call with other S&C \nlitigators \u201cre: SDNY examiner issues\u201d and 7/10ths of an hour for a \u201ccall with S. Peikin \nand SDNY and review of materials re: same,\u201d First S&C Fee Application, note 357 \nabove, at 346. \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN. L. REV. 369 (2025) \n435 \nthe \u201cwatchdog\u201d that did not bark.405 We do not fault the U.S. Trustee, however. \nAssuming our speculations are correct, we imagine that the Trustee had \nuncertain leverage within the Department of Justice, especially given the \nmagnititude of the underlying allegations and the public interest in \nprosecuting serious crimes. We discuss the problematic implications of these \npublic versus public conflicts in corporate reorganization in Part VI. \nD. The Public Interest and Bankruptcy Examinations \nAlthough Congress thought that examiners would vindicate the public \ninterest in chapter 11, they did not specify that interest, much less say how or \nwho should pay for it. In FTX, the debtors exploited this uncertainty by \noffering conflicting claims about the public interest in the FTX reorganization. \nOn one hand, they argued in response to the examiner request that there was \nnone at all. \u201cSection 1104 does not,\u201d they argued, \u201cauthorize the use of \nsubstantial estate assets to satisfy an undefined public interest or for a \u2018true \nneutral,\u2019 however that may be defined, to conduct an investigation that \nbenefits potential defendants or wrongdoers.\u201d406 \nOn the other hand, they argued, if there were a public interest, they would \naddress it by assisting public actors, such as prosecutors. \u201cGiven the \ninvestigation\u2019s [sic] already going on by the congressional committees, CFTC, \nSEC, the prosecutors,\u201d the UCC argued, \u201cthe public interest is being well-served \nin all of those ways.\u201d407 The creditors, \u201cwho are just going to want to get their \nfiat currency and crypto back,\u201d should not \u201cbe forced to bear the cost of an \nexamination that\u2019s only going to tell them the who, what, when, where, and \nwhy they lost money, but not actually give the money back.\u201d408 \nBut of course, creditors and other stakeholders would be forced to bear this \ncost, since the debtors\u2019 advisors billed the estate for their work supporting the \nU.S. Attorneys\u2019 office.409 The only difference was that their money would go to \nS&C, Ray, and other case insiders, rather than to an examiner and their \nprofessionals. \n \n405. The allusion is, of course, to the famous story in which a dog\u2019s failure to bark alerted \nSherlock Holmes that the dog knew the perpetrator of the crime.

Debtors\u2019 Objection to Motion of the United States Trustee for Entry of an Order \nDirecting the Appointment of an Examiner at 4, In re FTX Trading, Ltd., No. 22-11068 \n(Bankr. D. Del. Jan. 25, 2023), ECF No. 573 [hereinafter DIP Examiner Objection]. \n407. Examiner Hearing Transcript, supra note 307, at 122. \n 408. Id. at 130. \n 409. See supra Part III.B. \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN. L. REV. 369 (2025) \n436 \nIndeed, Ray had no qualms about forcing creditors to bear the cost of his \nand FTX\u2019s advisors\u2019 cooperation with prosecutors and other governmental \nofficials. In opposing the request for an examiner, he testified extensively about \nthe work that he, FTX, and S&C had done to support public actors\u2014support \nthat would, he argued, satisfy any public interest in the case: \u201cI made it very, \nvery clear from the beginning of my taking control . . . that we would do \nwhatever the Government request[ed] relative to cooperation.\u201d410 \nWe believe that, ultimately, not only is that, you know, required but we believe \nthat, you know, it\u2019s in the best interest of creditors to allow these regulatory \nauthorities to get full access to the information on a real time basis as we\u2019re \nlearning about what happened in the company. They\u2019re virtually getting \ninformation, again, real time, and we believe that was sort of fundamental to our, \nyou know, mission here which is to maximize value for the creditors.411 \nAlthough FTX was prudent to cooperate with prosecutors under these \nconditions, it is hard to see how \u201creal time\u201d cooperation with government \nactors would \u201cmaximize value for creditors.\u201d412 Wouldn\u2019t he and S&C have to \nevaluate the information before deciding whether divulging was in the \ninterests of the estate? Still, he continued: \nAs you can see, we\u2019ve collected ten terabytes of data, over twenty-seven million \ndocuments. We\u2019ve provided an analysis of several hundred thousand documents. \nWe\u2019ve interviewed and received proffers of 24 current and former employees. \nAnd then, we\u2019ve also provided an analysis relative to the transactions inside the \ncompanies [sic] databases.413 \nS&C wasn\u2019t cheap. At the hearing on the examiner motion, S&C\u2019s James \nBromley conceded that the debtors were spending \u201ctens of millions of \ndollars\u201d\u2014at least some on legal fees\u2014to vindicate their preferred version of the \npublic interest, supporting prosecutors: \nWhen we talk about the debtors furthering public policy, we have spent, literally, \ntens of millions of dollars, complying with public policy by reporting to the \nCongress, to the House, to the Senate, to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Southern \nDistrict of New York and three other Districts.414 \nThe \u201cburn rate\u201d in FTX\u2014the costs of professionals such as lawyers and \naccountants\u2014was astronomical, perhaps the highest ever, and estimated to be \n$1.5 million per day.415 Some cooperation was no doubt prudent, but here S&C \n \n410.

After \nfiling his report, the Examiner sought to continue the investigation for a second phase \nat a cost of an additional $3 million. See Examiner Phase II Order, supra note 40, \u00b6 4. \n417. If, as noted, the estate spends $1.5 million/day, and the case is in bankruptcy for two \nyears, then by November 11, 2024, it will have cost $900 million. See Archer, supra  \nnote 415. According to an email provided by Katherine Stadler, the Court-appointed \nfee examiner in FTX (a fee examiner performs a different role than statutory \nexaminers, and focuses only on professional fees), professionals had been paid over \n$500 million as of June 2024. See Email from Katherine Stadler, Godfrey & Kahn, to \nJonathan C. Lipson (Oct. 3, 2024, 10:48 AM) (on file with authors). Precise and current \nnumbers are difficult to obtain, but it is not hard to see that, by any measure, $6 million \nfor the Examiner is likely to cost less than 1% of the total cost of professionals for the \ncase. \n 418.

Examiner Report, supra note 41, at 35 (\u201cIn light of the record before the Court, the \nCourt\u2019s analysis of each of the objectors\u2019 arguments, and the wide discretion afforded to \nthe Court in determining whether disqualifying conflicts exist, the Examiner has \nconcluded that there was no error in the Court\u2019s decision concerning the Debtors\u2019 \nretention of S&C.\u201d). \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN.

On one hand, it contained a significant amount of information that \nwas not previously public, including as to the role that professionals other than \nS&C played in the rise and fall of FTX. It also explained the investigative \nprocesses that Ray, S&C, and others undertook, and provided insight into how \nFTX was able to manipulate the value of its token, FTT.422 \nOn the other hand, the Examiner conceded \u201csignificant\u201d limitations in his \nreport. He relied heavily on an investigation conducted by \u201cconflicts counsel,\u201d \nQuinn Emanuel.423 Quinn Emanuel\u2019s mandate was to investigate whether S&C \nattorneys knew of the commingling of customer deposits/funds with the \ncorporate assets of Alameda.424 \n\u201cSignificantly,\u201d the Examiner noted, \u201cQuinn Emanuel\u2019s investigative \nmandate had certain limitations.\u201d425 First, \u201cQuinn Emanuel was not asked to \nconsider and, hence, did not investigate, the broader question of whether S&C \nhad any conflicts of interest that might have disqualified it from serving as \ncounsel under Bankruptcy Code section 327.\u201d426 Quinn Emanuel did not do so \n\u201cbecause S&C\u2019s retention had already been approved by the bankruptcy \ncourt.\u201d427 Quinn Emanuel apparently did not investigate S&C\u2019s work for \nBankman-Fried or other insiders.428 Thus, there is no indication that Quinn \nEmanuel assessed the problematic tactics S&C used to wrest control of FTX \nfrom Bankman-Fried described in Part II.C above. \nSecond, there were limitations on the information to which Quinn \nEmanuel had access. Quinn Emanuel apparently interviewed seven S&C \n \n 420. See supra Part III.A. \n421. The Examiner Report indicates that it did consider this question. Examiner Report, \nsupra note 41, at 12 (\u201cThe Examiner has reviewed in detail the record before the Court \nregarding S&C\u2019s employment and considered whether facts outside the record should have \nbeen brought to the Court\u2019s attention.\u201d (emphasis added)). \n 422.

As discussed in Part II above, Binance played an important role in the \ndownfall of the debtors. And as explained in the next Part, Binance may have \nhad significant liability to the debtors\u2019 estates as a result of its actions, but Ray \nand S&C did not pursue any cause of action against Binance prior to plan \nconfirmation. \nThus, the Examiner\u2019s Report engaged none of the most critical evidence on \nthe most important questions about S&C\u2019s role leading up to the bankruptcy. \nWe do not fault the Examiner, however. Time and timing were problems, \nbecause he had only two months to complete the Report. S&C had delayed the \ninquiry for nearly a year and a half, by which time the endgame of the case\u2014\nthe company\u2019s plan of reorganization\u2014was in sight.441 If, however, an \nexaminer had been appointed at the outset and with a more fulsome mandate, \nwe expect that their report would have more effectively addressed the \nproblems we have identified, and perhaps others about which we do not know. \nV. Problems in the FTX Reorganization Process \nThe prior four Parts of this Article explained the role of the three public \ninterests in bankruptcy and used the example of FTX and S&C to illustrate \nhow advancing the third, non-bankruptcy interests may conflict with the first, \nprocess integrity. In this Part, we show how efforts to advance other interests \nalso appear to have undermined the bankruptcy-specific interest in \nmaximizing recoveries. \n \n437.

Undercutting FTX 2.0 \nIt is axiomatic that a profitable corporate debtor is worth more as a going \nconcern than sold as scrap. This is the rationale for leaving the debtor-in-\npossession in the control of its management, rather than appointing a \ntrustee.442 Yet it is unclear whether Ray and S&C made any serious effort to \nmaintain FTX as a going concern. \nBefore its liquidity crisis, FTX appears to have been profitable.443 As an \nexchange, revenue was driven by fees rather than by the value of \ncryptocurrencies.444 Indeed, within certain parameters, price volatility would \nbe good for an exchange, because such volatility implies more trading and thus \nmore fees from trading. \nAs explained in Part II, FTX halted withdrawals before the bankruptcy. It \ndid so due to the liquidity crisis triggered by the run on deposits in November \n2022.445 Bankman-Fried, meanwhile, was trying to obtain new financing to \ncover the liquidity gap.446 This made sense, and on the surface would appear to \nbe why Dietderich assured Bankman-Fried on November 9, 2022 that S&C was \n\u201chere to help\u201d that rescue effort \u201chowever we can.\u201d447 \nAccording to documents produced in connection with his sentencing, it \nappears Bankman-Fried had at least preliminary success. On November 9, \nTRON, another crypto business,448 executed a letter of intent to provide FTX a \n$4 billion credit facility.449 $4 billion in liquidity might have enabled FTX to \nrestart withdrawals and thus trading on the exchange. Of course, we do not \nknow what this financing offer was really worth, or whether restarting \nwithdrawals would have enabled Bankman-Fried to oversee a soft landing for \nFTX. He has claimed that the underlying technical problems\u2014in particular the \nfiat@ account\u2014had been addressed,450 but this is a difficult claim to verify. \n \n 442. See H.R. REP.

L. REV. 369 (2025) \n442 \nTwo days into the bankruptcy, on November 13, 2022, Bankman-Fried \nemailed Ryne Miller that he was \u201csuper happy to chat\u201d with Ray.451 This made \nsense, since S&C was continuing to assure Bankman-Fried that they were \n\u201chappy\u201d to discuss such possibilities with him, even though James McDonald, \nthe partner that said this, had already committed FTX to cooperate with the \ngovernment, apparently without telling Bankman-Fried.452 \nDespite S&C\u2019s assurances, Ray never responded. At a February 6, 2023 \nbankruptcy court hearing, he testified that he never spoke to Bankman-Fried \nbecause he \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was in the best interest of the estate to consult with \nlawyers for someone we now know has been charged with crimes.\u201d453 \nRay\u2019s timing was curious. Bankman-Fried was not indicted until  \nDecember 9, 2022, nearly one month after Bankman-Fried\u2019s offer to chat.454 \nUntil he was indicted, how could Ray know that he should not talk to \nBankman-Fried about how to save the company\u2014especially since Bankman-\nFried already seemed to have secured critical new financing? \nNot only did Ray refuse to talk to Bankman-Fried about keeping the \nexchange running, but he also permanently shut FTX down rather than \nmaking a serious effort to preserve it. S&C blamed it on Bankman-Fried: \u201cFTX \nwas an irresponsible sham created by a convicted felon,\u201d Dietderich said in \nJanuary 2024.455 \u201cThe costs and risks of creating a viable exchange from what \nMr. Bankman-Fried left in a dumpster were simply too high.\u201d456 \nThis is possible. But it is important to note that Ray and S&C said they \nrebuilt the debtors\u2019 books and records \u201cfrom scratch,\u201d457 which they would \nhave to do to determine which claims to pay. If so, and if the commingling of \nassets had stopped, Ray and S&C have failed to explain why the exchanges \ncould not have resumed trading. \nIndeed, for several months in the middle of the case, FTX told customers \nthat restarting the exchange\u2014which came to be known as \u201cFTX 2.0\u201d\u2014might be \npossible.458 In October 2023, FTX investment banker Kevin Cofsky said that \n \n451.

While the plan proposed as of \nMay 2024 would pay customers 127-142% of the face amount of their deposits \nas of the petition date, that date was in the depths of the crypto winter.463 In \nthe next year and a half, crypto assets tripled in value.464 If customers had \nsimply been permitted to keep their assets or been credited with their value \nbased on the debtors\u2019 rebuilt books and records, many customers would have \nreceived 300-400% of the face amount of their deposits as of November 2022. \nThis is not so far-fetched, as it approximated what crypto exchange Genesis \ndid under its bankruptcy plan.465 Sehgal told the Wall Street Journal that Ray \nand S&C were \u201cresponsible for destroying billions of dollars in value\u201d because \nFTX \u201chad a thriving business that was the No. 2 exchange in the world, and all \nthey had to do was turn it back on.\u201d466 \nNote also that FTX 2.0 might not have required the immediate payout of \ncustomers.

He did recommend a further investigation of potential avoidance \nactions against the non-insider shareholders who were not released in the sale \nand were apparently overpaid in the original transaction.493 \nThe timing and low value received in the LedgerX transactions suggest \nthat S&C\u2019s own interests may have conflicted with the interest in maximizing \nrecoveries. \nC.

The Examiner reasoned that \u201cit is not obvious that the term \u2018agent\u2019 is meant to \ninclude a law firm or any other professional, because the rest of the phrase refers to \ndirectors, officers and employees. Furthermore, S&C was not acting as LedgerX\u2019s \ncounsel in either the prepetition or postpetition sale transaction.\u201d Id. \u201cNotably,\u201d he \nreasoned, \u201cin a meeting with the Examiner, S&C represented that it does not view itself \nas an \u2018agent\u2019 that was released by this language. The Examiner expects that S&C would \nstand by this stated position.\u201d Id. The Examiner also agreed with S&C that it \u201cwas not \nacting as LedgerX\u2019s counsel in either the prepetition or postpetition sale transaction.\u201d \nId. (\u201cPrepetition, S&C represented [debtor] WRS.\u201d). That, however, is not the point: If \nS&C made any errors as to LedgerX, those errors involved its work before the CFTC, \nnot in the original sale transaction. Although the Examiner apparently to failed to \nrecognize this, S&C was clearly counsel to LedgerX for these purposes: It said so in the \nletter it sent to the CFTC withdrawing the controversial licensure application on the \nsame day it filed the debtors\u2019 bankruptcy petitions. See CFTC Withdrawal Letter, supra \nnote 202. \n493.

Under the Bankruptcy Code and \napplicable state law, a redemption of equity by a company that is \nundercapitalized is voidable as, in substance, a fraudulent transfer.497 This is \nespecially so where the redemption was intended to harm the debtor, as may \nhave been the case with Binance as FTX\u2019s competitor. At Bankman-Fried\u2019s \ntrial, the prosecution established that Binance was paid with FTX customer \nassets.498 Prosecutors argued that the Binance redemption was a leading reason \njurors should convict Bankman-Fried of fraud.499  \nDespite Binance\u2019s apparently significant role in the debtors\u2019 demise, FTX \nand Ray took no public action against the company until the last minute. The \ndelay would make it difficult for creditors to know whether the complaint was \nbeing prosecuted aggressively on their behalf, since that would take place after \nthe plan was confirmed, when creditor and court oversight would be reduced. \nIncredibly, the Examiner\u2019s Report said nothing about it, either. \nWhy would the estate fail to pursue a claim potentially worth over  \n$2 billion? Again, some signs point toward issues with S&C itself. First, it \nappears that since at least January of 2022, S&C white-collar defense lawyer \nJames McDonald (who had committed FTX to cooperating with prosecutors \n \n494. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 541(a), 548(a). \n 495.

Managing Conflicting Public Interests in Bankruptcy \nIn important recent work, scholars have begun to focus on the long-\nneglected issue of the public interests at stake in large corporate-\nreorganization cases. Melissa Jacoby has made the point, familiar in other \ncontexts, that even in a market system, private parties depend on the \ngovernment to enforce contracts and property rights.519 Bankruptcy is thus a \n\u201chybrid system,\u201d public as well as private.520 Focusing on a series of coal-\ncompany bankruptcies, Joshua Macey and Jackson Salovaara have shown that \nbankruptcy can sometimes be used to undermine the public interest by evading \nregulatory objectives.521 \nThe most sustained attention to governmental actors and the public \ninterest in bankruptcy has come from Jared Ellias and George Triantis. In one \nrecent article, they explored the use of bankruptcy by governmental actors to \nachieve public-interest objectives, concluding that bankruptcy can be a \u201cforce \nmultiplier,\u201d522 but also cautioning that this strategy may sidestep the ordinary \nconstraints that operate when the legislative or executive branches pursue \npublic-interest objectives.523 \nAn important lesson of the FTX bankruptcy is that failure to protect the \nintegrity of the judicial process\u2014in this case, by policing the lawyers\u2019 \nconflicting interests\u2014will infect every phase of the case. Not only did the \nconflicts undermine judicial oversight and the legal system, but they also seem \nto have interfered with the second public-interest objective, achievement of \ninsolvency-specific objectives such as maximizing the value of the bankruptcy \nestate through the reorganization process. Finally, although facilitating the \nprosecution of fraud is an important non-bankruptcy objective\u2014the third \ncategory of public interest\u2014S&C\u2019s conflicts may have distorted its incentives in \nproviding assistance to the U.S. Attorney and interfered with Bankman-Fried\u2019s \n \n519.

Adequate defense in a criminal case is also a public interest which, \nwhile distal from bankruptcy concerns, was apparently not considered \nimportant by the debtors in FTX. \nThe third form of public interest, use of bankruptcy to achieve substantive \nnon-bankruptcy governmental goals, needs to be carefully policed. \nGovernment actors may be tempted to sacrifice judicial process integrity or \nbankruptcy objectives such as maximizing the value of the estate. In addition, \nas Ellias and Triantis have pointed out, bankruptcy tends to be more rushed \nthan the administrative or judicial process, it lacks some of the safeguards of \nthose traditional venues for pursuing non-bankruptcy public interests, and \n\u201cbankruptcy judges are generally not experienced in being arbiters of complex \npolicy debates.\u201d524 \nIn FTX, some assistance given by John Ray and S&C to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s \noffice would have been justified, since it enabled prosecutors, who often face \ndebilitating resource constraints, to present a more effective case. But Ray and \nS&C did far more than simply make information available. Their advisors \nprocessed it for the prosecutors.525 This assistance may have undermined \nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense; it is possible, for instance, that Bankman-Fried \nlacked access to exculpatory information to which he would have been entitled \nunder the Brady doctrine if prosecutors searched FTX directly, rather than \nreceiving information that had already been analyzed by Ray and the FTX \nadvisors.526 And the assistance was paid for by FTX\u2019s stakeholders, since S&C \nbilled millions of dollars to the FTX estate, despite the absence of any apparent \nbenefit to the estate from the prosecution. \nJust as FTX illustrates how pursuit of substantive, non-bankruptcy public \ninterests can prove problematic, it also hints, by negative implication, at the \nmost obvious way to minimize the potential distortions: vigorously protecting \nthe first and second forms of public interest\u2014the integrity of the judicial \nprocess and the promotion of insolvency-related objectives such as \nmaximizing the value of the debtor\u2019s assets. If FTX had not been permitted to \nretain bankruptcy attorneys whose conduct cast a cloud over their role in the \nbankruptcy (i.e., if the first public interest had been properly recognized), it \n \n 524. Id. at 545. \n 525. See supra Part III.B (describing S&C\u2019s assistance of the prosecution). \n526. If prosecutors obtain exculpatory evidence, the Brady doctrine requires them to turn it \nover to the defense. See supra note 356 and accompanying text. However, if S&C \nprocessed any exculpatory evidence but did not give it to prosecutors, Brady would not \nbe triggered. S&C\u2019s role in determining which information prosecutors received may \nthus have limited Bankman-Fried\u2019s access to exculpatory evidence. Bankman-Fried \nraised this concern in his defense. See Discovery Brief supra note 353, at 11-13 (\u201c[T]he \ngovernment has outsourced its Brady obligations to an entity than has no Brady \nobligations whatsoever.\u201d). \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN. L. REV. 369 (2025) \n455 \nwould have been considerably less likely to overzealously support the \nBankman-Fried fraud prosecution, and fewer questions would have emerged as \nto whether FTX was maximizing the value of its assets. \nHow might we have expected a debtor and its professionals to determine \nhow much support to give to a prosecution effort? In our view, a debtor should \nalways provide a basic level of cooperation, such as turning over documents \nrequested by prosecutors. But in deciding whether to go beyond basic \ncooperation, the debtor and its professionals should balance the request for \nassistance against the objective of maximizing the value of the estate. If \nadditional cooperation will benefit the estate, the debtor and professionals \nshould provide it; but they should not supply costly additional assistance at the \nexpense of creditors and the estate. In FTX, this balancing does not seem to \nhave taken place. \nFTX is hardly the only case involving conflicting public and private \ninterests. The Chrysler bankruptcy provides another illustration.527 As the \nbankruptcy judge in Chrysler rightly pointed out, the U.S. government was \nfully entitled to serve as debtor-in-possession financer and to promote a sale of \nthe carmaker\u2019s assets, just as a private lender might.528 But the Court permitted \nthe U.S. government to restrict potential bidders to those that would support \nthe government\u2019s non-bankruptcy objectives of protecting Chrysler\u2019s \nunionized employees and promoting energy-efficient and green cars.529 A bid \nthat failed to conform to Treasury\u2019s bid\u2014by declining to assume Chrysler\u2019s \ncollective bargaining obligations and specified prebankruptcy debt, for \ninstance\u2014\u201cwould be considered only if the debtor, after consulting with \ncreditors, the Treasury, and the UAW, accepted it as qualified.\u201d530 This chilled \npotential bidding, thus undermining the bankruptcy objective of maximizing \nthe value received in a sale. \nIt is important to acknowledge that the second and third forms of public \ninterest can clash in the opposite direction as well: Pursuing bankruptcy \nobjectives can undermine important non-bankruptcy objectives. Macey and \nSalovaara\u2019s work on corporate debtors\u2019 use of bankruptcy to minimize pension \nobligations furnishes a ready illustration.531 In our view, these frictions are \n \n 527. In re Chrysler LLC, 405 B.R. 84 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2009). \n 528.

What are \u201cDisinterested\u201d Bankruptcy Lawyers? \nPerhaps the single most disturbing theme in our findings is the extent to \nwhich S&C\u2019s conflicting incentives permeated FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing and \nevery aspect of the case. Although S&C touted the Examiner\u2019s findings,532 it is \nimportant to note that the Examiner did not say the firm was \u201cdisinterested\u201d\u2014\nthe standard that matters. Instead, he said that the bankruptcy court made \u201cno \nerror\u201d in appointing the firm in light of the \u201cwide discretion\u201d governing \nappointments and the record before the court at the time.533 \nS&C\u2019s conflicts appear reminiscent of the conflicts in the old equity \nreceivership cases, but in especially worrisome form due to the allegations of \nongoing fraudulent behavior prior to bankruptcy.534 S&C came in well before \nFTX\u2019s collapse and was linked in important ways to FTX\u2019s prebankruptcy \nmisbehavior.535 Given that so many large law firms now have both a corporate \nand a chapter 11 practice, the S&C problem is likely to recur. That is, elite law \nfirms representing other large businesses will attempt to use their existing \nrelationship with the company to secure the lucrative role of serving as the \ndebtor\u2019s attorneys in bankruptcy if the company encounters trouble.  \nChapter 11 would then provide protection for both debtors and their lawyers. \nThe most decisive solution to this risk would be to restore the definition of \ndisinterestedness that the New Deal reformers incorporated into the 1938 \nbankruptcy reforms, as updated for modern chapter 11.536 Congress could \nforbid lawyers who represented a debtor before its distress from serving as its \nlawyers in bankruptcy. But a debtor\u2019s desire to retain its prebankruptcy \nlawyers in chapter 11 is not always problematic. If there is no evidence the \nlawyers were aware of or involved in potentially problematic prebankruptcy \nbehavior, the likelihood of conflicts may be low. And the debtor\u2019s \n \n532. Dietrich Knauth, FTX Bankruptcy Lawyers Were Not Complicit in Fraud, Report Finds, \nREUTERS (May 23, 2024), https://perma.cc/VG2F-HWSE/ (noting S&C\u2019s statement that \n\u201cwe welcome the examiner\u2019s findings to date rejecting various baseless allegations \nabout our work for FTX\u201d). \n533. Examiner Report, supra note 41, at 35. \n534. Supra note 108 and accompanying text. \n 535. See supra Parts II.A-.B. \n536. The old disinterestedness requirement applied to the trustee, because Chapter X \nrequired that the debtor\u2019s managers be replaced by a trustee. Because trustees are rarely \nappointed in chapter 11, the requirement should apply to the debtor (the \u201cdebtor-in-\npossession,\u201d in bankruptcy speak). We discuss this history in Parts I.C through I.E \nabove. \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN. L. REV. 369 (2025) \n457 \nprebankruptcy lawyers have the advantage, as compared to a new law firm, of \nalready being familiar with the company and its operations. \nRather than barring prebankruptcy lawyers from chapter 11 debtor \nrepresentation altogether, we recommend a more nuanced approach. If the law \nfirm represented the debtor when the debtor may have engaged in serious \nmisconduct, a court should apply a nearly irrebuttable presumption that the \nfirm cannot serve as the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy counsel. The firm certainly \nshould not be retained without a preliminary examination by an outside \ninvestigator of the sort we propose in the next section. \nEven absent allegations of fraud or misbehavior, courts should scrutinize \napplications for retention of debtors\u2019 pre-distress lawyers more closely than \nwith entirely new counsel. The court should take into account the extent of \nthe prebankruptcy representation and the types of matters handled. Courts \nshould be especially wary of last-minute disclosures by firms with a significant \nprebankruptcy relationship with the debtors or other parties in interest. A law \nfirm that played a limited role and was not involved in transactions that may \nbe the subject of avoidance actions is less worrisome than a law firm that was \nintimately involved in potentially problematic transactions. \nThe scrutiny we advocate requires no legislative change. Under the \ncurrent definition of disinterestedness, a law firm does not qualify if it has an \ninterest \u201cmaterially adverse\u201d to the estate.537 Our proposal does, however, \nrequire bankruptcy judges to ask harder questions earlier in large and complex \ncases. \nC. Re-Examining Examiners \nA critical tool to help avoid these conflicts already exists, in the form of \nexaminers. Prior research has found that the timing of an examiner request \nmatters: The earlier it is made, the more likely it is to succeed.538 This did not \nhappen in FTX, however, due to S&C\u2019s objections and the unusual secrecy of \nthe case. \nIf the U.S. Trustee\u2019s request for an examiner had been granted at the outset, \nthe report might have looked very different. That report might have more \nfully considered the evidence that emerged after the retention decision, \nincluding the evidence presented in Part II. It might have resulted in a \nrecommendation to change the debtor\u2019s general counsel (S&C could have \nremained special counsel for certain purposes under Section 327(e)). If so, the \nconcerns we raised may have been allayed. \n \n537. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14)(C). \n538. Lipson & Marotta, supra note 50, at 33. \n\nFTX\u2019d \n77 STAN. L. REV. 369 (2025) \n458 \nThe parties in FTX resisted an examiner on grounds that it would be \nexpensive and redundant with other investigations, including those being \nconducted by counsel in the bankruptcy and the prosecutions of insiders.539 \nConcerns about cost are legitimate but ironic given that the FTX examiner cost \nless than one percent of estimated professional expenses.540 But the Third \nCircuit\u2019s opinion teaches that these costs, large or small, must be balanced \nagainst the first-order public interest in judicial integrity.541 \nTo address problems of timing and cost, bankruptcy judges should \nauthorize preliminary examinations to determine whether further inquiry is \nappropriate.542 In a preliminary examination, the U.S. Trustee would appoint \nan independent examiner at the outset of any case in which there were credible \nconcerns of the sort identified by Congress (e.g., fraud, mismanagement). \nBankruptcy courts would then approve these appointments early in the case, \ngiving the examiner a clear focus and limited budget. If the preliminary \nexamination finds no reason for further inquiry, the public interest is satisfied \nand costs are minimized. \nIf, however, the preliminary examination reveals the need for further \ninquiry, a full examination would be required. The preliminary examiner \nshould presumptively be ineligible to undertake a full examination, in order to \nreduce the incentive to \u201cfind\u201d matters for further investigation. \nPreliminary examinations in a broader swath of cases could help to address \ngrowing concerns about the integrity of the bankruptcy system. \nUnderstanding that an outsider will investigate and report on credible \nallegations of problematic conduct may also help to ameliorate a persistent \nsense that corporate reorganization is rigged in favor of insiders.543 S&C\u2019s \nefforts to return to a leadership role in this practice area via FTX shows how \nlucrative it can be.544 \nD. Re-Examining the Role of the U.S. Trustee \nAnother implication of our findings is that public actors pursuing \ndifferent public-interest objectives may come into tension, just as the private \nparties in the case do. With FTX, we suspect that the U.S. Trustee\u2019s watchdog \nobligations may have conflicted with the needs of the U.S. Attorney for the \n \n 539. See supra Part IV.B.1. \n 540.

REV. 369 (2025) \n459 \nSouthern District of New York, another branch of the Department of Justice, \nwhich apparently relied heavily on S&C for information and analysis\u2014and \npossibly even the tip that triggered or accelerated the prosecution in the first \nplace.545 If the U.S. Trustee had pursued S&C\u2019s conflicts more aggressively or \nquestioned the use of estate funds to support the Bankman-Fried prosecution, \nthese efforts might have compromised the government\u2019s interest in a speedy \nprosecution whose cost was borne by FTX creditors (and not just U.S. \ntaxpayers). \nHow is a conflict between the U.S. Trustee and others within the \nDepartment of Justice supposed to be resolved? It is not clear which units have \npriority. But it seems likely that the U.S. Trustee would be expected to be \nresponsive to the interests of other branches of the Department of Justice, \nespecially an important U.S. Attorney\u2019s office such as the Southern District of \nNew York.546 \nPractitioners such as S&C benefit from the uncertainty. As sophisticated \nintermediaries between public and private actors (e.g., LedgerX and the CFTC \nbefore the collapse), they may be able to triangulate negotiations among public \nactors in ways that help their clients or, indeed, themselves, as appears to have \nbeen the case in FTX.547 While public-on-public conflicts are inevitable in a \nlarge and fractious democracy, we worry about the implications of leaving the \nU.S. Trustee at the mercy of other, larger forces in the Department of Justice \nand in private practice. \nThese problems would be greatly alleviated if the U.S. Trustee had more \nindependence. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is \nhoused in the Federal Reserve but largely insulated from interference, is an \nobvious example of how this might be done.548 The best way to enhance the \nU.S. Trustee\u2019s capacity might be to give it a similar status, although we \nrecognize this currently is not politically feasible, given how controversial the \nCFPB\u2019s protection from outside interference has been and the pushback a \nproposal to enhance another watchdog\u2019s authority would face.549 \n \n 545. See supra notes 262-66 and accompanying text (describing S&C\u2019s outreach to \nprosecutors and agreement to provide them with documents).  \n546.

Ct. 1474, 1479 (2024) (describing \nthe CFPB\u2019s independent structure). \n549.

REV. 369 (2025) \n460 \nAlternatively, the U.S. Trustee could be subject to \u201cfirewall\u201d protection, as \nhappens within law firms that have potential conflicts of interest. That system \nwould assure that the lawyers with the conflict are screened out of the case \n(and away from the lawyers who work on it). Other public actors within the \nfederal government (especially the Department of Justice) who may be adverse \nto the U.S. Trustee or the debtors\u2019 estate, should be restricted in their capacity \nto influence the U.S. Trustee and its actions in chapter 11. \nThe U.S. Trustee is often seen as a gadfly in chapter 11 by the insiders who \ndominate large cases.550 Whereas many bankruptcy judges are prominent \nbankruptcy lawyers before ascending to the bench, the staff of the U.S. \nTrustee\u2019s office are often outsiders. Greater independence might not alter the \nU.S. Trustee\u2019s outsider status, but it would enhance the prestige of the U.S. \nTrustee\u2019s office and enhance its ability to attract top talent, akin to the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission or CFPB. This would enable the U.S. \nTrustee to better promote all three forms of public interest and to police \nefforts by the debtor\u2019s attorneys or other professionals to compromise the \npublic interest in pursuit of their own private interests. \nConclusion \nSam Bankman-Fried was quick to concede that he \u201cf\u2019d up,\u201d and there is \nlittle doubt that he did. This Article has shown that, in relinquishing control of \nhis companies at the behest of lawyers who appear to have been motivated by \ntheir own concerns, he was also \u201cFTX\u2019d up,\u201d inadvertently aiding the \nsubversion of all three forms of public interest. While we do not challenge the \njury\u2019s verdict or the company\u2019s need to use chapter 11, we worry about \nattorneys who marshal and manipulate arguments about the \u201cpublic interest\u201d \nin order to advance or protect their own interests. Chapter 11 knows no \nexception to the old adage, \u201ctwo wrongs do not make a right.\u201d \nOur worries derive from our detailed case study of FTX, the first of its \nkind of one of the most important bankruptcies of recent decades. Based on our \ninvestigation and an examination of the historical evolution of conceptions of \nthe public interest in corporate reorganization, we have developed a typology \nof public-interest concerns and suggested ways in which the principal \ncustodians of the public interest in chapter 11 can be improved. To fail to take \nthese public interests seriously is to risk further harm to the chapter 11 system. \n \n 550.

Overcoming the asthma \nthat plagued him as a child, Singh completed the 100 miles in just over 23.5 hours, setting a world \nrecord for the fastest 100-mile run by a 16-year old.1 A TED Talk describing his impressive feat \nfollowed soon after. At the time, Singh was an honors student at an elite private school in Silicon \nValley. One of his close friends was Gabe Bankman-Fried, the younger brother of Sam Bankman-Fried, \ninformally referred to as SBF.  \n \nFive years later, after graduating from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in electrical \nengineering and computer science, Singh began working for Alameda Research (Alameda), a crypto \ntrading firm founded by SBF and Tara Mac Aulay, an Australian mathematician,2 and eventually led \nby CEO Caroline Ellison. Within a short period of time, Singh was wearing two hats: in addition to his \nengineering role at Alameda, he led engineering at FTX, the crypto exchange founded by SBF and Gary \nWang. (See Exhibit 1 for equity breakdown for Alameda and FTX.) \n \nBy early 2022, FTX was the second-largest crypto exchange in the world. It, purportedly, ended 2021 \nwith $388 million in income on $1.02 billion in revenue.3 In February 2022, after its series C fundraiser, \nthe 3-year-old exchange was valued at $32 billion (Exhibits 2 and 3). For the first half of 2022, FTX \nhad a trading volume of $76 billion, a 19% increase over the same period the year before,4 with more \nthan nine million customer accounts.5 \n \nBut then, everything came crashing down and fast. On November 11, 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy. \nOn December 12, the U.S. Department of Justice charged SBF with eight counts of fraud, money \nlaundering, and campaign finance offenses6 and summarily arrested him. He was charged with \nfunneling billions of dollars of FTX customer funds to Alameda, which went toward startup \n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED\u2019S FTX \nNemit Shroff and Cate Reavis \nJanuary 17, 2024 \n2 \n \ninvestments, real estate purchases, political donations, and personal expenditures.7 SBF pled not guilty. \nWang and Ellison faced similar charges. They pled guilty.  \n \nIn February 2023, Singh, who held a 5% equity stake in FTX,8 was charged and pled guilty to six \ncriminal counts, including conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money \nlaundering, and conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws. Singh admitted to writing software code \nthat allowed SBF to divert FTX customer funds to Alameda. He admitted making illegal political \ncontributions using Alameda money and hiding the source of the funds. He also admitted to inflating \nFTX\u2019s 2021 revenues by about $50 million, thereby pushing the company\u2019s year-end revenue to more \nthan $1 billion by making up new transactions and then backdating them in the company\u2019s transaction \nhistory. All of these actions were at the request of SBF.9 \n \nThe meteoric descent of FTX left many confused as to what had happened, why it had happened, and \nhow it had been able to happen? Who was to blame? And what could be done to prevent it from \nhappening again?  \nSam Bankman-Fried \nSam Bankman-Fried was an easily recognizable eccentric.10 Unless testifying before Congress, he \ndressed in shorts and T-shirts, even while making formal presentations. His hair was wildly unkempt. \nHe was known to sleep in a beanbag chair in his office. He played video games, loved \u201cLeague of \nLegends,\u201d and was once caught playing it while pitching FTX to investors from the venture capital firm \nSequoia.11 Since moving FTX from Hong Kong to the Bahamas in 2021, after China outlawed crypto \ntrading, SBF had lived with nine other colleagues, including Wang, Ellison, and Singh, in a $35-million \nluxury penthouse, which Alameda paid for.12 SBF would end up having an on again, off again \nrelationship with Ellison for two years. \n \nSBF grew up on the Stanford University campus where his parents were law professers. His father was \na renowned tax expert. He was raised as a utilitarian: a theory of morality that advocates decisions that \nfoster the greatest happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people.13 \n \nDuring his undergraduate years at MIT, where he studied math and physics, SBF became an adherent \nof effective altruism or EA: a philsophy that seeks \u201cto do good in the most clear-sighted, ambitious, \nand unsentimental way possible.\u201d14 He committed himself to an offshoot of EA known as \u201cearning to \ngive,\u201d which urges followers with lucrative careers to earn as much as they can before giving it away.15 \nSBF ventured into his professional career guided by this philosophy. \n \nAfter graduating from MIT in 2014, he took a job with Jane Street\u2014a quantitative trading firm that \nspecialized in arbitrage trading strategies. While there, he gave half his salary to charity.16 He also \ndiscovered the world of crypto.   \n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED\u2019S FTX \nNemit Shroff and Cate Reavis \nJanuary 17, 2024 \n3 \n \nCrypto \nOn October 31, 2008, amidst the economic turmoil brought on by the global financial crisis, the \npseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper entitled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash \nSystem.\u201d17 The paper\u2019s purpose was to introduce \u201ca new electronic cash system that\u2019s fully peer-to-\npeer, with no trusted third party,\u201d such as a bank. In other words, there was no private or public sector \nentity overseeing the system. Operating outside the banking system meant that Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin, \nthe world\u2019s first cryptocurrency,i would not be \u201cmarred\u201d by the destabilizing bank runs that sometimes \noccurred in traditional finance.18 Users of this system could send and receive cryptocurrency over the \nInternet without needing to involve a bank or an app like PayPal or Venmo.19 The first commercial use \nof Bitcoin was in May 2010 when a customer paid 10,000 Bitcoins (equivalent to $40 at the time) for \ntwo Papa John\u2019s pizzas. In November 2021, when the price of Bitcoin hit its peak,10,000 Bitcoins \nwere worth $688 million.  \n \nCrypto exchanges like FTX allowed hundreds of different cryptocurrenices and tokens to be traded in \nexchange for other crypto assets or fiat currency (legal tender issued by a country).20 The more \nprominent exchanges were Coinbase, Binance, and FTX.  \n \nCoinbase was a publicly traded exchange. Based in the U.S., it offered consumers a user-friendly \ninterface and trading experience21 and followed a basic exchange model: A customer opened an account \nand asked the exchange to buy one Bitcoin with the money in their account. Coinbase bought the \nBitcoin and held it for the customer in a custody account while charging them a fee for the transaction. \nBecause Coinbase did not use customer funds to make loans or investments with the objective of \nearning a return for the company, it had the liquidity to return money to customers when requested. \nCoinbase was considered a bank-run-proof business: it did not have to worry about an adverse liquidity \nevent even if all its customers simultaneously asked for their money back.22 \n \nThe largest cryptocurrency exchanges\u2014Binance, founded by Chinese billionaire Changpeng Zhao \n(known as CZ), and FTX\u2014specialized in higher-risk derivatives and leverage trading. Derivative \ncontracts allow traders to speculate on the price movements of cryptocurrencies without actually \nowning the underlying asset. Leverage trading (or margin trading) with crypto is when an investor \nborrows crypto from a broker to create a bigger position in a trade, beyond what they could buy with \ntheir own cash. Managing risk was a critical component for these two exchanges. Exhibit 4 \ndemonstrates the risks incurred by exchanges in facilitating derivative and leverage trading with crypto. \nDerivatives and leverage trading of crypto were prohibited in the United States. Both Binance and FTX \noperated separate exchanges in the U.S. that complied with its stricter trading regulations.   \n \n \ni Cryptocurrency refers to a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography and based on a network that is distributed across a large \nnumber of computers.  \n \n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED\u2019S FTX \nNemit Shroff and Cate Reavis \nJanuary 17, 2024 \n4 \n \nSome exchanges issued their own crypto tokens. Exchange tokens are designed to increase an \nexchange\u2019s liquidity, by incentivizing trading activity. They could also be bought, sold, and traded like \ncoins, but while crypto coins (e.g., Bitcoin) were like dollars, tokens were more like coupons or \nvouchers.23 Exhange tokens could also serve as collateral. FTX\u2019s token, which it minted itself,24 was \nknown as FTT. As an exchange token, they could be traded on secondary markets or held for speculative \npurposes. FTTs were not available to trade on any major U.S. crypto exchanges.25 \n \nOwners of FTTs received discounts on FTX trading fees, the ability to earn interest, and various benefits \non the FTX exchange. They could also be used to trade derivatives.26 From time to time, FTX would \nuse its profits to buy back and \u201cburn\u201d (retire) FTTs (permanently taking tokens from circulation), \nthereby reducing the supply of the token, which potentially increased its price. As a result, the value of \nFTTs was loosely tied to the performance of FTX. While exchange tokens weren\u2019t stocks\u2014i.e., they \ndidn\u2019t represent an ownership interest in the issuing company\u2014they acted like stocks in that they \nrepresented a bet on a crypto company\u2019s future.27  \nRegulating Crypto \nRegulation of crypto varied significantly from country to country. Japan had one of the most \nprogressive crypto policies28\u2014it began recognizing Bitcoin and other digital currencies as currency in \n201629\u2014while China outlawed crypto in 2021. In the Bahamas, where FTX moved its headquarters in \n2021, regulations were favorable to digital asset firms.30 Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis was a \ncrypto fan, saying crypto entrepreneurs were \u201cbetter wired for innovation and change than most people \non the planet.\u201d31  \nIn the U.S., there were rules prohibiting certain crypto trading instruments (including derivatives) that \nleveraged bets\u2014the very instrument that made up 80% of FTX\u2019s global revenue.32 But there was one \noverarching question hampering regulatory efforts: who should be the sheriff of crypto? The answer \nseemed to depend on whether crypto should be considered a security or a commodity. Or should it \ndepend on the type of token?33  \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), responsible for enforcing regulations, protecting \ninvestors, and ensuring fair markets, believed cryptocurrencies were securities (like stocks and bonds) \nand should be registered with the government and follow the same rules. The purpose of registration \nwas to provide investors and the government details about management and business practices and at \nleast two years of audited financial data. Registration could take several months and cost over $1 \nmillion.34 Of the thousands of crypto tokens in circulation, only a tiny fraction were registered with the \nSEC.35 When it came to crypto exchanges, the SEC believed that they, too, should be registered and \nfollow the same rules as the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange. But none were.36  \n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED\u2019S FTX \nNemit Shroff and Cate Reavis \nJanuary 17, 2024 \n5 \n \nMeanwhile, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates derivatives \ntrading of commodities,ii believed cryptocurrencies fell under its jurisdiction.37 The commission used \nthe example of Bitcoin: because Bitcoin was \u201cinterchangeable on exchanges, each Bitcoin is of identical \nworth, just like how a sack of corn is equal to another sack of corn of the same grade,\u201d and therefore \nshould be treated as a commodity.38  \nSBF wanted digital assets to be treated like commodities and regulated by the CFTC.39 In February \n2022, he testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, \nhighlighting his support for regulation and for the CFTC as the appropriate regulatory body. The CFTC \nwas considered a less-aggressive regulator than the SEC.40 \nThe Founding of Alameda Research and FTX \nDuring his time at Jane Street, SBF began experimenting with crypto arbitrage. He bought Bitcoin in \nthe U.S., sold it in Japan for a 10% premium, and pocketed the difference. SBF left Jane Street, and in \nNovember 2017, he and fellow effective altruist Tara Mac Aulay co-founded Alameda. SBF had no \nmanagement experience and Mac Aulay had no financial background but was successful at crypto \ntrading which she did in her spare time.41 Wang, SBF\u2019s MIT roommate, described as a recluse who \nhardly ever spoke, was hired as CTO. Singh joined them a month later as director of engineering. The \nstartup focused on crypto arbitrage and made $20 million in its first three weeks.42  \n \nInitially headquartered in Berkeley, California, Alameda soon moved to the more crypto-friendly Hong \nKong, where there was little oversight over the nascent industry43 and where it wasn\u2019t shunned as it \nwas by U.S. banks and Wall Street firms because of its lack of regulation and oversight.44 SBF owned \n90% of the company. Most of the people Alameda hired in its early days were EAs without experience \ntrading in financial markets or, for that matter, interest in money. As Michael Lewis wrote in his \nintimate portrayal of SBF and his businesses in Going Infinite, \u201cMost [employees] neither knew nor \ncared about crypto; they had just bought into Sam\u2019s argument that it was this insanely inefficient market \nin which they might use his Jane Street-like approach to trading to extract billions.\u201d45 Soon enough, \nAlameda was making over 250,000 trades a day. \n \nBut SBF\u2019s grip on Alameda was tested in early 2018. His management team lost confidence in him \nwhen, among mounting trading losses, he reported losing track of over $4 million worth of XRP, a \ncryptocurrency issued by the exchange RippleNet. He told Alameda managers that in his estimation \n\u201cthere was an 80% chance that it would eventually turn up. Thus they should count themselves as still \nhaving 80% of it.\u201d46 Singh, who was described as painfully considerate, saw the merit in both sides of \nan argument, and adept at easing internal tensions tried to calm the growing discord between SBF and \nAlameda managers.47 But to no avail.  \n \n \nii A commodity is a basic good like wheat, coffee, or oil that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type. \n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED\u2019S FTX \nNemit Shroff and Cate Reavis \nJanuary 17, 2024 \n6 \n \nAfter discovering SBF\u2019s ineptitude for managing the buinsess and realizing that in order for SBF to \nleave Alameda, he had to want to leave, Mac Aulay, most of its management team, and half of \nAlameda\u2019s employees, quit en masse in April 2018.48 Wang, who held a 10% stake,49 Singh, and \nEllison, who was hired in March 2018, remained. The missing XRP eventually turned up and Alameda \nresumed making millions of dollars in profit monthly.50  \n \nSBF soon became frustrated with how existing crypto exchanges were run and decided to start his \nown.51 Again with Wang, he founded FTX in May 2019. Incorporated in Antigua and Barbuda and \nlocated in the Bahamas, FTX specialized in crypto derivatives and leveraged products, both of which \nwere prohibited in the U.S. FTX made money by taking a cut of two basis points (or two one-hundredths \nof 1%) on most transactions.52 Shortly after its launch, FTX introduced FTTs for $0.10 a token. In the \nbeginning, SBF saw FTTs as a way to secure loans and build an equity cushion for FTX.53 Alameda \nowned 60% to 70% of FTTs and was able to get loans more easily. By September 2021, FTTs reached \na peak of $80. Various crypto lenders ended up giving Alameda $9.4 billion in loans.54  \n \nFTX offered customers a number of services. Through the company\u2019s spot market platform, customers \ncould trade crypto assets with other FTX customers in exchange for fiat currency or other crypto assets. \nIts spot market trading service allowed customers to trade using assets they did not have (trading on \nmargin) by posting collateral, including FTTs, in their FTX accounts and borrowing crypto assets \nthrough the spot market on the FTX platform. FTX also allowed customers to lend their crypto assets \nto other FTX customers who would then use them to spot trade.55 Alameda was FTX\u2019s largest customer. \n \nTrading through the exchange was easy. As one journalist wrote, \u201cFTX serves as a portal to the crypto \nworld. With the click of a button, a curious investor can turn dollars into Bitcoin, Dogecoin, or Ether. \nIt\u2019s as simple as buying paper towels from Target.\u201d56    \n \nNot only was trading easy, it was safe, according to SBF. With software code developed by Wang and \nSingh,57 the exchange had built-in protections to manage risk. The company\u2019s risk engine calculated a \ncustomer\u2019s margin every 30 seconds. If the collateral on deposit fell below the required margin level, \nthe automated system would start selling assets from the customer\u2019s portfolio until the collateral on \ndeposit exceeded the required margin level.58 As SBF tweeted in October 2022, FTX\u2019s approach to risk \nmanagement was \u201cconservative and handles apparent large moves gracefully\u201d and was \u201cprobably the \nmost important thing we do at FTX.\u201d59 SBF touted the importance of having protections to manage risk \nin his testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services: \u201c[I]f you \nlook at what precipitated some of the 2008 financial crisis, you will see a number of bilateral, bespoke, \nnon-reported transactions happening between financial counterparties, which then got repackaged and \nreleveraged again and again and again, such that no one knew how much risk was in that system until \nit all fell apart.\u201d60 \n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED\u2019S FTX \nNemit Shroff and Cate Reavis \nJanuary 17, 2024 \n7 \n \nThe White Knight \nFTX seemed to be everywhere at the beginning of 2022. Athletes and celebrities including Steph Curry, \nTom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, and Matt Damon were featured in various television and print media ads \npromoting the brand. The company paid $6.5 million to air a Superbowl commercial starring Larry \nDavid and $135 million for the naming rights to the Miami Heat\u2019s arena. \n \nThen the crypto industry crashed. May 2022 was dubbed the crypto industry\u2019s \u201cLehman moment,\u201d \nreferring to the 2008 collapse of the financial services firm Lehman Brothers at the start of the global \nfinancial crisis.61 With rising interest rates, growing inflation, and the war in Ukraine, the crypto \nindustry was struggling in the early months of 2022. Investors were pulling back. Lenders began calling \nin their loans, including those to Alameda. Worth $2.9 trillion in November 2021, the global \ncryptocurrency market fell to $926 billion by June 2022.62  \n \nFTX, and its sister trading company, Alameda, which had been co-led by Ellison since October \n2021,went on a spending spree to help prop up failing crypto companies in order to prevent a contagion. \nThe press began referring to 30-year-old SBF as the industry\u2019s modern-day J.P. Morgan, its white \nknight.63 Alameda, FTX, and SBF himself\u2014he was at that time worth over $21 billion64\u2014made \nsubstantial investments in a number of crypto firms at risk of going under. In May, Alameda loaned \ncrypto lender Voyager Digital nearly $446 million, only to have Voyager declare bankruptcy weeks \nlater. In June, FTX provided crypto bank BlockFi with a $400 million credit facility with an option to \nbuy the firm for up to $240 million. (BlockFi had been valued at $4.75 billion a year earlier.65) It wasn\u2019t \nthe first time SBF and his companies had propped up the crypto industry. A year earlier, FTX had given \nJapanese crypto exchange Liquid $120 million in financing. FTX acquired Liquid in March 2022 for \nan undisclosed sum.66  \n \nSBF explained that his investments were meant to backstop customer assets of the companies he was \ninvesting in and stop a potential crypto contagion. \u201cI want to be in a position where when we work with \npeople, we\u2019re a little more generous than we have particular reason to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bigger piece \nof this is a trust thing where I don\u2019t want to have to worry when I\u2019m doing a deal about whether the \nother side is going to try and f*ck me in 20 ways I\u2019m not anticipating.\u201d67  \nA Leaked Balance Sheet \nWhile its private decent began earlier, FTX\u2019s public decent began on November 2, 2022, when the \ncrypto trade publication CoinDesk leaked Alameda\u2019s balance sheet.68 It showed the company had $14.6 \nbillion in assets, of which 40% were in FTT. Alameda and FTX collectively owned roughly 90% of the \ntokens, leaving a small amount to circulate widely. The relative scarcity of the FTT in the market meant \nthat FTX and Alameda could not sell their FTT holdings without significantly moving the price of FTT \ndownward, raising questions about the stated value of the FTT asset on their balance sheets.69 \nImportantly, the underlying value of FTT was loosely tied to the performance and value of FTX, and \n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED\u2019S FTX \nNemit Shroff and Cate Reavis \nJanuary 17, 2024 \n8 \n \nconcerns about FTX\u2019s value led investors to begin losing faith in the value of FTT. A lower price for \nFTT made FTX\u2019s balance sheet look worse \u2013 and so a death spiral began.  \n \nAlameda\u2019s CEO Caroline Ellison attempted to calm the growing nervousness and tweeted on \nNovember 6:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEllison\u2019s tweet was useless. That same day, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who owned 23 million \nFTT tokens worth $580 million, announced that he would be selling his holdings.70 The price of FTT \ndropped by 80% over the next two days. (See Exhibit 5 for FTT price drop.) A run on FTX ensued, \nwith customers wanting to withdraw funds from the exhange all at once. In the 72 hours leading up to \nNovember 8, customers withdrew over $6 billion in deposits.71   \n \nTo assuage growing doubts about FTX\u2019s solvency, SBF tweeted: \u201cFTX is fine. Assets are fine\u2026 FTX \nhas enough to cover all client holdings. We don\u2019t invest client assets (even in treasuries). We have been \nprocessing all withdrawals, and will continue to be\u2026\u201d72 He later deleted that Tweet.  \n \nBehind the scenes, SBF searched for emergency funding to cover FTX\u2019s shortfall of $8 billion. He was \nturned down at various stops in Silicon Valley and the Middle East.73 In his quest, he shared an Excel \nbalance sheet that indicated FTX had $9 billion in liabilites and that, of its $9.6 billion in assets, only \nabout $900 million was liquid, including $472 million of Robinhood shares.74 (In May 2021, SBF spent \n$648 million of his \u201cown money\u201d to buy a 7.6% stake in the trading app Robinhood.75) The company\u2019s \nlargest overall asset, which fell in the less-liquid column, was $2.2 billion worth of a cryptocurrency \ncalled Serum (SRM).76 At the time SBF was searching for funding, Serum\u2019s liquid market cap (i.e., \ncurrent price \u00d7 circulating supply) was $88 million,77 which suggested that the asset would be worth \nfar less than than its paper value on FTX\u2019s balance sheet if sold into the market.78 (Exhibit 6 presents \nFTX\u2019s balance sheet as published in The Financial Times.) After striking out in his various financing \nstops, SBF called his archrival Zhao asking for a lifeline.79  \n \nOn November 8, FTX paused all withdrawals. Meanwhile, Zhao tweeted that Binance might buy FTX \nafter a full-scale due diligence. But within 24 hours, Zhao backed out, claiming that FTX\u2019s \u201cissues are \nbeyond our control or ability to help.\u201d80 He then went on to tweet two big lessons from FTX\u2019s downfall: \n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED\u2019S FTX \nNemit Shroff and Cate Reavis \nJanuary 17, 2024 \n9 \n \n\u201c1. Never use a token you created as collateral, and 2. Don\u2019t borrow if you run a crypto business. Don\u2019t \nuse capital \u2018efficiently\u2019. Have a large reserve.\u201d81  \n \nThe Bahamian regulator entered the picture on November 10 when it froze FTX\u2019s assets. FTX and 100 \nrelated entities, including FTX.US and Alameda, filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. SBF \nresigned. It was soon discovered that FTX had more than one million creditors.82  \n \nJohn Ray, who oversaw the $23 billion bankruptcy following Enron\u2019s collapse in 2001, was appointed \nCEO and chief restructuring officer. Ray claimed FTX was the biggest mess he had ever seen:  \n \nNever in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete \nabsence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here. From compromised systems \nintegrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a \nvery small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this \nsituation is unprecedented.83  \n \nRay discovered that FTX operated with no independent board of directors\u2014the board consisted of SBF, \nan FTX employee who headed over-the-counter and institutional sales who stepped down from the \nboard in June 2022 and left the firm in October 2022, and an unnamed lawyer from Antigua and \nBarbuda84\u2014and lacked the most basic internal controls. The company had no accounting department85 \nand no CFO listed as part of its leadership team.86 \n \nOn Monday, December 12, 2022, SBF was arrested in the Bahamas and charged in the U.S. with eight \ncriminal counts.iii None of the charges involved FTX.US. SBF\u2019s net worth, which at its peak was \nreportedly $26.5 billion, fell to $100,000 around the time of his arrest.87 \n \nClaiming he was a flight risk, the judge in the Bahamas denied bail. SBF was eventually extradited to \nthe U.S., where he pled not guilty and was released to his parents in Palo Alto, California, on a $250 \nmillion bail, secured by his parents\u2019 home.iv (In August 2023, SBF\u2019s bail was revoked for intimidating \nwitnesses and he was sent to the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York City until his trial.88) \nEllison and Wang, both 28-years-old, were also criminally charged. Unlike SBF, they both pled guilty \nand were cooperating with prosecutors. Days earlier, CEO Ellison had admitted to Alameda employees \nthat she, SBF, and Wang were aware that Alameda had used FTX customer funds to meet its own \n \niii The U.S. Department of Justice charged SBF with conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers; wire fraud on customers; conspiracy to commit wire fraud \non lenders; wire fraud on lenders; conspiracy to commit commodities fraud; conspiracy to commit securities fraud; conspiracy to commit money laundering; \nand conspiracy to defraud the United States and violate the campaign finance laws. \niv The $250 million bond that was secured by SBF\u2019s parents did not mean they put up assets totaling $250 million. But, if SBF fled while out on bail, they \nwould be responsible for paying the $250 million bond. In August 2023, SBF\u2019s bail was revoked for intimidating witnesses and he was sent to Metropolitan \nDetention Center in New York City until his trial.  (Jack Queen, \u201cExplainer: How Did Bankman-Fried Secure $250 Million Bail?\u201d Reuters, December 23, 2022, \nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/how-did-bankman-fried-secure-250-mln-bail-2022-12-\n22/#:~:text=Bankman%2DFried%27s%20bail%20was%20secured,home%20in%20Palo%20Alto%2C%20California., July 24, 2023.) \n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED\u2019S FTX \nNemit Shroff and Cate Reavis \nJanuary 17, 2024 \n10 \n \nliabilities.89 Singh, 27-years-old, was charged and pled guilty in February 2023 to six charges, similar \nto the conspiracy charges against Ellison and Wang and one charge for violating campaign finance \nlaws. \nThe Unveiling \nIn addition to the U.S. Department of Justice criminal charges, SBF faced civil charges from the SEC \nand the CFTC. Singh\u2019s involvement became clear when he pled guilty a few months later. \n \nThe SEC complaint that applied from May 2019 through November 2022 described activities at FTX \nand Alameda that were never disclosed to investors or customers. The SEC complaint90 included the \nfollowing: \n \nUndisclosed diversion of FTX customers\u2019 funds to Alameda Research LLC. FTX customers \ndeposited billions of dollars into Alameda-owned bank accounts, some which didn\u2019t have the name \nAlameda (e.g., North Dimension, which was an Alameda subsidiary). Singh helped write the code that \nenabled these deposits and created the website for North Dimension. Alameda commingled these funds \nand used them indiscriminately to fund its trading operations and SBF\u2019s other ventures, including $5 \nbillion invested in tech companies.91 Alameda\u2019s multibillion-dollar liability was reflected in an internal \naccount in an FTX database known as fiat@ftx.com. The balance sheet that Alameda provided third-\nparty lenders identified this liability as a \u201cloan,\u201d but did not specify that it was from FTX. It combined \nthis liability with other loans it had received from third-party lenders. In 2021, SBF had directed \nAlameda to borrow billions of dollars from third-party crypto asset lending firms (who act as \nintermediaries between crypto lenders and borrowers) to fund his venture investments and for his \npersonal use.  \n \nUndisclosed special treatment afforded to Alameda on the FTX platform. FTX gave Alameda \nspecial privileges on the exchange including a nearly limitless \u201cline of credit\u201d (eventually reaching $65 \nbillion), which was funded by FTX customer assets. FTX allowed Alameda\u2019s collateral on deposit \n(mostly FTTs) to fall below FTX\u2019s required margin level without having any of its portfolio liquidated \nby FTX\u2019s automated risk monitoring. All of this was possible due to Wang and Singh\u2019s changing code \nto include an \u201callow negative\u201d feature (i.e., allowed Alameda to have a negative balance).92  \n \nIn May 2022, under the direction of SBF, Alameda drew on its line of credit, diverting billions in FTX \ncustomer assets to repay Alameda\u2019s third-party loan obligations. As crypto assets were losing value, \nlenders, such as Genesis Global Capital,93 began demanding loan repayment. Alameda did not have \nsufficient funds to pay them. SBF propped up Alameda by illegally transferring at least $4 billion in \nFTX customer funds to Alameda, secured by assets including FTT and shares in Robinhood.94   \n \nUndisclosed risk stemming from FTX\u2019s exposure to Alameda\u2019s significant holdings of overvalued \nilliquid assets such as FTX-affiliated tokens. Alameda\u2019s collateral on deposit consisted of enormous \n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED\u2019S FTX \nNemit Shroff and Cate Reavis \nJanuary 17, 2024 \n11 \n \namounts of illiquid crypto including FTX\u2019s token FTT. FTX valued FTTs at trading prices but \nAlameda\u2019s collateral was not worth the value it was assigned.  FTX and Alameda held the vast majority \nof the tokens; only a small portion was in circulation. As a result, the token\u2019s value was not really \nvalidated by the external market.  \n \nUndisclosed use of FTX customers\u2019 funds at Alameda to make undisclosed venture investments, \nreal estate purchases, and political donations most of which were in Singh\u2019s name. Some of FTX \ncustomers\u2019 funds that were transferred to Alameda were used by FTX executives for personal reasons. \nSBF, Wang, Singh, and one other FTX executive received a total of $4.1 billion in loans from Alameda, \nmoney which was spent on investments, real estate, and political donations. (SBF had a super PAC \nwhich gave $5.6 million to Joe Biden and $10 million to a Democratic state congressional candidate in \nOregon. Singh donated $8 million.)  \n \nUndisclosed close relationship between FTX and Alameda. SBF assured customers and investors \nthat FTX customer assets were secure and hid Alameda\u2019s close relationship with FTX. FTX\u2019s Terms \nof Service, listed on its website, assured customers that their assets were secure: \u201c[Y]ou control the \nDigital Assets held in your Account\u201d; \u201c[t]itle to your Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you \nand shall not transfer to FTX\u201d; and \u201cnone of the digital assets in your account are the property of, or \nshall or may be loaned to, FTX Trading.\u201d The terms of service also stated: \u201cOnce we receive fiat \ncurrency we may issue you an equivalent amount of electronic money (E-Money) which represents the \nfiat currency you have uploaded\u201d and \u201c[y]ou may redeem all or part of any E-Money held in your \naccount at any time.\u201d  \n \nThe website assured investors that it segregated customer assets from its own assets across its platforms \nand that the exchange maintained \u201cliquid assets for customer withdrawals\u2026[to] ensure a customer \nwithout losses can redeem its assets from the platform on demand.\u201d \n \nWhen pitching to investors, FTX provided audited financial statements that did not include information \nabout Alameda\u2019s \u201cline of credit\u201d from FTX.  \nWhere Were They? \nIn the weeks and months after FTX imploded, stunning customers and investors alike, questions of \nwhat happened began dominating the press. Answers as to the what slowly began trickling out and were \ncommunicated by investigative bodies like the SEC. But there were few answers as to how FTX\u2019s \nplunge into bankruptcy could have happened. There was much fingerpointing.  \n \nWhere were the investors? FTX had raised $1.8 billion over seven rounds from more than 80 investors. \nMany were well-known venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital, SoftBank, BlackRock. And yet, \nthey invested without requiring FTX to have better governance structures in place.95 Investors didn\u2019t \ndemand financial audits,96 nor did they balk at the inherent conflicts of interest between FTX and \n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED\u2019S FTX \nNemit Shroff and Cate Reavis \nJanuary 17, 2024 \n12 \n \nAlameda. Meanwhile, SBF had majority ownership of FTX despite all the money he had raised. He \nwas transparent about running his company with little oversight. One investor recalled him saying that \ninvestors should \u201csupport him and observe.\u201d97  \n \nWhat about the auditors? Where were they? As a private company, FTX was not required to be audited \nor to share financial results with U.S. regulators. Nevertheless, SBF announced in August 2021 that \nFTX and FTX.US had been audited by Prager Metis and Armanino, respectively. Both were small \nfirms, far less reputable than the Big Four\u2014PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, and \nKPMG.98 Neither firm was asked (nor were they required) to audit FTX\u2019s internal controls. \n \nBoth Prager Metis and Armanino were among a group of audit firms targeting digital asset and \ncryptocurrency businesses. Some accused the firms of being crypto industry cheerleaders. Prager Metis \nposted a photo on social media showing its auditors attending a baseball game with FTX executives, \nadding \u201cproud to support FTX US.\u201d When SBF was set to meet with a U.S. congressional committee \nin December 2021, Armanino tweeted, \u201cLet\u2019s go buddy.\u201d99 Just weeks after FTX went bankrupt, \ninvestors began filing lawsuits against Prager Metis and Armanino for being \u201cwillfully blind\u201d to a \npattern of \u201cracketeering.\u201d100 Did these auditors fail to do their job? \n \nAnd where were the regulators? What role did they play or fail to play? FTX was an offshore crypto \nexchange, outside the jurisdiction of U.S. regulators. Even so, were there regulations that could have \nhelped prevent the massive losses that millions of U.S. customers and investors faced? Or would \nenacting a strict regulatory system for crypto continue to push the industry away from the U.S. and to \ncountries with weak regulation?  \n \nWhat about FTX customers? Were they in some way to blame for their losses for not doing their \nhomework and trusting FTX with their funds? \n \nOne of the first groups to be singled out for blame were the athletes and celebrities who had touted FTX \nvia television commercials, social media, and other means. Many of them were named in a class-action \nlawsuit that was filed just days after the collapse of FTX. Included in this group was Larry David and \nTom Brady.101 \n \nQuestions of blame included FTX employees. Where were Wang and Ellison? What did they know and \nwhen? And what about Nishad Singh? By his own account, he was first made aware during a September \n2022 meeting with SBF that billions of dollars of FTX customer deposits had been spent by Alameda. \nHe was blindsided. He felt horrified, and betrayed.102 But even after his being told, and acknowledging \nhis own culpability by changing FTX\u2019s code that gave Alameda special privileges, Singh stayed at the \ncompany. He did not blow the whistle. He did not quit in protest.  \n \n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED\u2019S FTX \nNemit Shroff and Cate Reavis \nJanuary 17, 2024 \n13 \n \nOne month after his meeting with SBF, Singh spent $4 million on a 10-acre estate on Orcas Island in \nthe State of Washington.  \n \n \n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED\u2019S FTX \nNemit Shroff and Cate Reavis \nJanuary 17, 2024 \n14 \n \nExhibit 1 \nAlameda and FTX Key Executives\u2019 Ownership Stake \nAlameda Trading \nFTX \n \nSam Bankman-Fried \n90% \n60% \n \nGary Wang \n10% \n16% \n \nCaroline Ellison \n0% \n0.5% \n \nNishad Singh \n0% \n5% \n \n \nSources: Michael Lewis, \u201cPlay It Again, Sam,\u201d The Washington Post, October 1, 2023 \n(https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/interactive/2023/michael-lewis-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto/, accessed January \n22, 2024);

If called as a witness, I would testify truthfully to \nthe matters stated in this Declaration.   \n \nCommencement of FTX Digital\u2019s Provisional Liquidation and Appointment of \nthe JPLs \n6. \nOn November 10, 2022, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas (the \u201cSCB\u201d) \nsuspended the registration of FTX Digital under section 19 of the DARE Act.  On that date, the \nSCB petitioned the Bahamas Court for the winding up and provisional liquidation of FTX Digital, \nwhich was granted (the \u201cProvisional Liquidation\u201d) and the Bahamas Court appointed Brian \nSimms KC as provisional liquidator.  The next day, FTX Trading Ltd. (\u201cFTX Trading\u201d), along \nwith the other U.S. Debtors, commenced these cases.  On November 14, 2022, the Bahamas Court \n \n2  \nCapitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Motion. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194    Filed 03/29/23    Page 2 of 8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nRLF1 28794376v.1 \nalso appointed Kevin G. Cambridge and myself as joint provisional liquidators. Pursuant to the \nProvisional Liquidation order, the JPLs displaced FTX Digital\u2019s officers and directors. \n7. \nOn November 15, 2022, soon after our appointment, the JPLs filed a petition on \nbehalf of FTX Digital for recognition of a foreign proceeding under chapter 15  in the United States \nBankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the \u201cChapter 15 Case\u201d).  On November \n28, 2022, this Court entered an agreed order to transfer venue of the Chapter 15 Case to this Court \n[Case No. 22-11217].  On February 15, 2023, this Court recognized FTX Digital\u2019s Provisional \nLiquidation as a foreign main proceeding and the JPLs as the foreign representatives of the FTX \nDigital estate in the U.S.  \n8. \nImmediately following our appointment, the JPLs began investigating all aspects \nof the relationship between FTX Digital and FTX Trading.  Thus, the JPLs have needed to \n(i) identify which persons or entities were or are FTX Digital\u2019s accountholders, customers, and \ncreditors, (ii) determine the legal relationship between FTX Digital and those who are identified \nas such, and (iii) recover assets for all FTX Digital\u2019s stakeholders, to be distributed in accordance \nwith Bahamian law and procedure.   \n \nFTX Trading  \n9. \nFTX Trading was incorporated on April 2, 2019, and is a company organized under \nthe International Business Company Act, CAP. 222 of Antigua.  Immediately following its \nformation, FTX Trading was headquartered, along with the rest of the FTX group of companies \n(the \u201cFTX Group\u201d), in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People\u2019s Republic of \nChina. \n10. \nFTX Trading was originally responsible for running FTX\u2019s international digital \nasset exchange platform (the \u201cFTX International Platform\u201d) \u2014 the platform through which the \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194    Filed 03/29/23    Page 3 of 8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nRLF1 28794376v.1 \nFTX Group did business with somewhere between 2.5 million to upwards of 7.4 million customers, \nall located outside the United States (\u201cInternational Customers\u201d).  Its business was to operate \nfor non-U.S. customers and permitted these non-U.S. customers to engage in various digital asset \ntrading and exchange activities where users could enter into both spot transactions of \ncryptocurrency assets and also to transact derivative products including \u201cperpetual futures,\u201d \n\u201coptions,\u201d \u201cmove contracts,\u201d and \u201cleveraged tokens.\u201d  At the time of FTX Trading\u2019s incorporation, \nno jurisdiction had a sufficiently regulated exchange system for the institutional funds that the \nFTX Group\u2019s founders sought to attract. \n11. \nU.S. persons were not permitted to trade on the FTX International Platform (that is, \nthe platform accessible at FTX.com).  FTX Trading never carried on any business in the United \nStates, and explicitly forbade U.S. persons from using the FTX International Platform, as it was \nnot licensed to offer services to U.S. customers. Therefore, the JPLs believe that all of the \ncustomers affected by the directions application that the JPLs propose to file in The Bahamas (the \n\u201cApplication\u201d) are not U.S. citizens.  A true and correct copy of the Application is attached hereto \nas Exhibit A-1.  A true and correct copy of the Draft Affidavit of Brian C. Simms KC, which the \nJPLS propose to file in support of the Application (the \u201cApplication Affidavit\u201d) is attached hereto \nas Exhibit A-2. \n \nFTX Digital and the Migration \n12. \nOn December 14, 2020, the Commonwealth of The Bahamas enacted a \ncomprehensive licensing and regulatory regime for the digital asset industry pursuant to the DARE \nAct.  As discussed below, the FTX Group decided to move its international exchange business, to \nthe full extent possible under the DARE Act, from FTX Trading to FTX Digital, in order to legally \noperate out of The Bahamas and comply with Bahamian regulations and law.  Thus, following the \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194    Filed 03/29/23    Page 4 of 8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nRLF1 28794376v.1 \nenactment of the DARE Act, by July 22, 2021, FTX Digital was incorporated in The Bahamas.  \nAlthough it appears that FTX Trading was operating out of The Bahamas at the time, based on our \ninvestigation FTX Trading never registered as a foreign company under Bahamian law and holds \nno DARE Act licenses. \n13. \nIn August 2021, FTX Digital prepared a document called \u201cFTX Digital Markets \nLimited Customer Migration Plan\u201d (the \u201cMigration Plan\u201d) approved by then-CEO of FTX \nDigital, Ryan Salame.  A true and correct copy of the Migration Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit \nB. \n14. \nThe FTX Group began to execute on that plan by, among other things, moving the \nFTX Group\u2019s management team to The Bahamas and establishing the headquarters of the FTX \nGroup there.  Starting in July 2021, at least 38 individuals, including, importantly, all three of the \nco-founders, senior management, and key employees began moving from Hong Kong to The \nBahamas and transferred their employment from other FTX Group entities, to become employees \nof FTX Digital.  Before the appointment of the JPLs, FTX Digital employed 83 individuals, most \nof whom resided in The Bahamas. \n15. \nOn September 10, 2021, FTX Digital was registered as a Digital Asset Business \nunder the DARE Act, becoming the only FTX Group entity regulated to run the FTX International \nPlatform for most of the products on the platform.  Entities licensed under the DARE Act are \npublicly registered.  The DARE Act proscribes the carrying on of a digital asset business in or \nfrom within The Bahamas unless registered under the DARE Act. \n16. \nBefore May 2022, International Customers entered into contracts with FTX \nTrading by accepting FTX Trading\u2019s terms of use (\u201c2019 Terms of Service\u201d).  A true and correct \ncopy of the 2019 Terms of Service is attached as Exhibit C.  On May 13, 2022, new terms of \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194    Filed 03/29/23    Page 5 of 8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nRLF1 28794376v.1 \nservice (\u201c2022 Terms of Service\u201d) were uploaded to the FTX.com site.  A true and correct copy \nof the 2022 Terms of Service is attached hereto as Exhibit D.  The 2022 Terms of Service explicitly \nspecified that FTX Digital was the \u201cService Provider\u201d for nearly all digital asset product lines \noffered on the FTX International Platform, and permitted FTX Trading to novate its position under \nthe Terms of Service to another party, including FTX Digital.  2022 Terms of Service \u00b6 37.2, \nSchedules 2-7.  FTX Trading remained the service provider for the NFT Market (Schedule 11) and \nthe NFT Portal (Schedule 12) (together, the \u201cUnregulated Services\u201d) because the DARE Act did \nnot permit the Unregulated Services to be migrated to FTX Digital.  FTX Trading also remained \nthe service provider for the leveraged tokens spot market (Schedule 8), the BVOL/iBVOL \nvolatility market (Schedule 9) (the \u201cOther Services,\u201d and together with the Unregulated Services, \nthe \u201cRemaining FTX Trading Services\u201d).  Based on the information available to the JPLs to date, \nthe Remaining FTX Trading Services that stayed with FTX Trading represented no more than 10% \nof the business on the FTX International Platform. \n17. \nBetween November 2021 and June 2022, FTX Digital opened certain bank \naccounts in FTX Digital\u2019s name (the \u201cFTX Digital Accounts\u201d) which were used to receive and \nsend fiat currency from and to International Customers.  Starting in January 2022, it was clear that \nInternational Customers were using the FTX Digital Accounts to on-ramp (deposit) and off-ramp \n(withdraw) fiat to and from their accounts on the International Platform.  Based on our \ninvestigations to date, during the period January 20, 2022 through November 12, 2022, the FTX \nDigital Accounts maintained in FTX Digital\u2019s name had receipts of $13.4 billion and outflows of \nthe same amount.  From January 20, 2022 through October 31, 2022, the institutional International \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194    Filed 03/29/23    Page 6 of 8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nRLF1 28794376v.1 \nCustomer account in FTX Digital\u2019s name had receipts of $9.2 billion and withdrawals of $8.9 \nbillion.     \n18. \nSince the FTX Group conspicuously relocated its headquarters to The Bahamas in \n2021, The Bahamas remained the nerve center of FTX\u2019s business operations.  It is understood that \nFTX Trading operated out of The Bahamas before portions of the International Customers were \nmigrated to FTX Digital.   \n \nThe JPLs\u2019 Bahamas Application seeking Leave to File the Motion \n19. \nUntil the Non-U.S Law Customer Issues set out in the Application are decided, we \ncannot progress FTX Digital\u2019s Provisional Liquidation.  If the stay does apply to the Application, \nmaintaining it would effectively stop the Provisional Liquidation because it cannot progress until \nthe JPLs ascertain the identity of their creditors or their estate\u2019s assets. \n20. \nThe JPLs have sought for months to jointly tee up these issues with the U.S. \nDebtors.  Having had no engagement on the topic, counsel to the JPLs sent the U.S. Debtors\u2019 \ncounsel a draft of the Application on March 9, 2023.  A true and correct copy of the JPLs\u2019 March \n9 letter to the U.S. Debtors\u2019 counsel is attached hereto as Exhibit E.  The U.S. Debtors\u2019 counsel \nresponded on March 11, 2023, that all of the matters in the Application must be handled in \nDelaware.  A true and correct copy of the U.S. Debtors\u2019 March 11 letter is attached hereto as \nExhibit F.  On March 13, 2023, counsel to the JPLs wrote to the U.S. Debtors again, to address the \nU.S. Debtors\u2019 misunderstanding of the Application and proposed a date for a telephonic conference \nto further discuss these issues.  A true and correct copy of the JPLs\u2019 March 13 letter to the U.S. \nDebtors\u2019 Counsel is attached hereto as Exhibit G.  On March 15, 2023, the JPLs, their counsel, \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194    Filed 03/29/23    Page 7 of 8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nRLF1 28794376v.1 \ncounsel for the U.S. Debtors, and John Ray, held a telephonic conference regarding the Application \nand a proposed path for cooperation.   \n21. \nOn March 15, 2023 the JPLs filed an application with the Bahamas Court seeking \nleave to file this Motion (the \u201cBahamas Lift Stay Application\u201d).  A hearing on the Bahamas Lift \nStay Application was scheduled and held on March 20, 2023.  Counsel for the U.S. Debtors were \nprovided notice of the Bahamas Lift Stay Application and appeared at the hearing.  They did not \nhave any objections to entry of an order granting the Bahamas Lift Stay Application (the \n\u201cBahamas Lift Stay Order\u201d) and therefore the Bahamas Court entered the Bahamas Lift Stay \nOrder on March 21, 2023.

In developing \nthis policy, FDM has considered the operational, technical and regulatory aspects of its approach to the \nmigration.  \nOBJECTIVE \nThis policy\u2019s objectives are to:  \n\u25cf \nPresent FDM\u2019s plan to migrate customers to its business from FTX.  \nAPPORTIONMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES \nFDM clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of all individuals with oversight of, and/or involvement in, the \nmigration of customers.  \nFDM\u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES \nFDM is ultimately responsible for the onboarding of customers according to the firm\u2019s AML/CFT Policy. \nFDM\u2019s key roles and responsibilities in relation to the migration of customers are outlined below: \n\u25cf \nAppropriately communicating the new terms of service to its customers. \n\u25cf \nEnsuring customers are risk assessed and onboarded according to the AML/CFT Policy. \n\u25cf \nEnsuring any gaps in the due diligence requirements are filled. \nSENIOR MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe CEO is the primary person responsible for the migration of customers from FTX to FDM. To do so, the CEO \nwill appoint a person(s) with sufficient seniority, skills, and experience to oversee the process of migration. The  \nCompliance Officer and MLRO will play a key part in the migration of customers from FTX to FDM, particularly \nregarding customers who are considered high risk and/or a PEP.  \nFDM will engage with FTX senior management in order to have a clear understanding of the transition objectives \nand milestones from the parent. \nThe CEO and CO will engage with FTX customer support and marketing in order to ensure both FTX and FDM are \naligned on the transition, from messaging to the operational execution. The ultimate objective is a smooth \ntransition from a user experience perspective. Front end and back end systems should also reflect a shift of \nactivity to FDM as smoothly as possible, subject to regulatory considerations.  \nTERMS OF SERVICE \nCustomers who will be migrated from FTX to FDM will be required to accept new terms of service and the \nsharing of information from FTX to FDM prior to onboarding. As the migration commences, customers will be \nnotified of the change and will be given a period of 90 days to raise any queries, comments, or concerns to the \ncentralised customer support team, before accepting the new terms of service and sharing of information or \nwithdrawing their funds. If customers do not actively accept the new terms of service or the sharing of \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-3    Filed 03/29/23    Page 5 of 6\n\n \n5 \ninformation within 90 days and do not remove all of their funds, they will be assumed to have accepted the \nnew terms of service and be migrated.  \nGAP ANALYSIS \nFDM will conduct a gap analysis to identify any differences between the due diligence conducted on customers \nby FTX and the requirements of FDM. During the migration process, customers will be required to provide any \nadditional due diligence information that FDM would need to obtain in order to comply with the requirements \nof its AML/CFT Policy. Customers who are unable to provide the required information during their respective \nmigration window, will have their FDM account restricted, unless mitigating circumstances apply. \nRISK ASSESSMENT \nCustomers who migrate to FDM will be risk assessed according to its AML/CFT Policy, following the risk \nassessment, the customer will be assigned their relevant risk score. As part of the risk assessment, customers \nwill be screened for any PEP and/or sanctions matches. If any matches are discovered, the relevant actions will \nbe taken according to the AML/CFT Policy. \nMIGRATION PLAN \nThe FDM migration hierarchy is based on customers trading volume, followed by customer type (i.e. \ninstitutional or retail). In order to ensure a smooth and well-managed transition, the migration is expected to \nbe completed by 2023.  \nHigh volume users represent a small number of customers which provide a high amount of volume and hence \nrevenue to FDM, as such they will be prioritised and migrated first. The other institutional customers will \nfollow, also representing a small number of higher volume customers.  \nOnce institutional customers have been migrated, FDM will focus on migrating individuals. Low risk individuals \nwill be migrated first as there will be less friction in terms of due diligence requirements, and it is believed \nmost of these customers will not require further due diligence other than that which is shared from FTX to \nFDM. Medium and high risk individual customers will be the last to be migrated. These customers may require \nfurther due diligence documents and reviews by the CO/MLRO.  \nPlease see the table below for the expected time frame for the migration of customers. FDM will provide \nquarterly updates to the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB) with the actual number of customers \nthat have been successfully migrated. \nCustomer Type \nNumber of Clients \nto be Migrated \n(expected) \n \nMigration \nCommencement \nDate \nExpected \nMigration \nCompletion Date \nActual Customers \nMigrated \nto Date \nHigh volume \n(institutional) \nFee VIP & Tier 6 \nQ4 21 \nQ1 22 \n \nOther Institutional \nFee Tiers 2-5 \nQ1 22 \nQ2 22 \n \nIndividual low risk \nAll Fee Tiers \nQ2 22 \nQ3 22 \n \nIndividual medium risk \nAll Fee Tiers \nQ3 22 \nQ4 22 \n \nIndividual high risk \nAll Fee Tiers \nQ4 22 \nQ1 23 \n \n \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-3    Filed 03/29/23    Page 6 of 6\n\nEXHIBIT C \n2019 Terms of Service \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-4    Filed 03/29/23    Page 1 of 20\n\nFTX EXCHANGE: TERMS OF SERVICE \nThe following terms and conditions of service (the \u201cTerms\u201d) constitute an agreement between \nyou and FTX Trading LTD (\u201cFTX Trading,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d), a company incorporated in Antigua \nand Barbuda, and apply to your use of FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange (\u201cFTX\u201d or the \n\u201cExchange\u201d) as a user (\u201cUser\u201d, \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d) to buy, sell, exchange, hold, or otherwise \ntransact in Digital Assets (as defined below), use the FTX Application Programming Interface \n(\u201cAPI\u201d), or use any other services offered through the FTX website (ftx.com) (the \u201cSite\u201d) \n(together, the \u201cServices\u201d).

For the avoidance of doubt, continued use of your Account, and the \nreceipt of all trading fee discounts and rebates, is conditioned on your continued compliance at \nall times with these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations. \n2.\nELIGIBILITY \nIf you are registering to use the Services as an individual, you must be at least 18 years of age, \nand you must not have been previously been suspended or removed from the Exchange or any \nother service or product offered by FTX Trading or its affiliate entities, to enter into this \nAgreement. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-4    Filed 03/29/23    Page 2 of 20\n\nIf you are registering to use the Services on behalf of a legal entity, you represent and warrant \nthat (i) such legal entity is duly organized and validly existing under the applicable laws of the \njurisdiction of its organization; (ii) you are duly authorized by such legal entity to act on its \nbehalf; and (iii) such organization (and any affiliate entity) must not have been previously \nsuspended or removed from the Services or any other service or product offered by FTX \nTrading or its affiliate entities, to enter into this Agreement. \nBy accessing or using the Services, you further represent and warrant that you are not a \nRestricted Person nor are you a resident of a Restricted Territory (each as defined in Section \n33) and you will not be using the Services for any illegal activity including, but not limited to, \nthose Restricted Activities listed under Section 19. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, FTX Trading may determine not to make the Services, in whole \nor in part, available in every market, either in its sole discretion or due to legal or regulatory \nrequirements, depending on your location. \n3.\nREGISTRATION PROCESS; IDENTITY VERIFICATION \nWhen registering your Account, you must provide current, complete, and accurate information \nfor all required elements on the registration page, including your full legal name.  You are the \nonly person authorized to use your Account and you may not share your Account credentials \nwith any other person.  You also agree to provide us, when registering an Account and on an \nongoing basis, with any additional information we request for the purposes of identity verification \nand the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime, \nincluding without limitation a copy of your government issued photo ID or evidence of residency \nsuch as a lease or utility bill.

These standards are designed to prevent the use of the FTX platform for money \nlaundering or terrorist financing activities.  We take compliance very seriously and it is our policy \nto take all the necessary steps to prohibit fraudulent transactions, report suspicious activities, \nand actively engage in the prevention of money laundering and any related acts that facilitate \nmoney laundering, terrorist financing or any other financial crimes. \n5.\nINITIAL FUNDING; THIRD PARTY TRANSFERS \nIn order to fund your Account and begin trading, you must first procure Digital Assets.  FTX \nsupports deposits and withdrawals for a number of Digital Assets, including certain U.S. Dollar-\npegged Digital Assets (each a \u201cStablecoin\u201d).  You may deposit Stablecoins that you already \nown by generating an address within your Account and sending your Stablecoins to such \naddress, after which they should appear in your \u201cUSD Stablecoins (USD)\u201d balance.  The \nExchange may support various fiat currencies for deposit, withdrawal, and/or trading, using wire \ntransfers, credit cards, or other appropriate methods.  A partial list of fiat currencies supported \nby the Exchange can be found here. \nFTX enables you to exchange (\u201cConvert\u201d) one Digital Asset for another Digital Asset.  When \nyou request to Convert a Digital Asset or Stablecoin, you will be quoted a price for such \nconversion.  The price quoted will depend on market conditions, and you are under no \nobligation to execute a trade at any price quoted to you.  FTX Trading makes no promises as to \nthe timing or availability of the ability to convert Digital Assets via the Exchange. \nIt is your responsibility to ensure you send all Digital Assets, including Stablecoins, to the correct \naddress provided for that particular Digital Asset.  If you send a Digital Asset to an address that \ndoes not correspond to that exact Digital Asset (such as an address not associated with your \naccount or the specific Digital Asset sent), such Digital Asset may be lost forever.  If you send a \nDigital Asset from your Account to an external address that does not correspond to that exact \nDigital Asset, such Digital Asset may be lost forever. \nYou assume all liability for any losses incurred as a result of sending Digital Assets to an \nincorrect address (such as an address not associated with your account or an address not \nassociated with the specific Digital Asset).  FTX Trading is not responsible for any losses or for \ntaking any actions to attempt to recover such Digital Assets.  If the funds are recoverable, we \nmay in our sole discretion attempt to recover the funds, but such recovery efforts are in no way \nguaranteed.  Please also be aware that if you attempt to deposit ETH to your Account by \nsending it via a smart contract, your funds may not be automatically credited, and may take time \nto recover.  Should you encounter any of these issues, you may contact us us to request \nassistance. \nFTX Trading makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time that may be \nrequired to complete transfer of your Digital Assets from a third party wallet or other source and \nhave said Digital Assets become available in your Account. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-4    Filed 03/29/23    Page 4 of 20\n\nWhen you elect to transfer Digital Assets from your Account to a third party wallet or other \nlocation, it is always possible the party administering the new location may reject your transfer \nor that the transfer may fail due to technical or other issues affecting our platform. You agree \nthat you shall not hold FTX Trading liable for any damages arising from a rejected transfer. \n6.\nFUTURES CONTRACTS \nThe futures listed by FTX include three contracts for each Digital Asset or index (each a \n\u201cFutures Contract\u201d).  These include two quarterly Futures Contracts (with expiration at the end \nof the current and subsequent quarters) as well as perpetual Futures Contracts. \nFutures trading on FTX is high risk.  In order to trade Futures Contracts on FTX, you must post \ncollateral.  Depending on market movements, your position may be liquidated and you may \nsustain a total loss of Digital Assets.  This is because futures trading is highly leveraged, with a \nrelatively small amount of funds used to establish a position in a Digital Asset or index having a \nmuch greater value. If you are uncomfortable with this level of risk, you should not trade futures \ncontracts. \nYou agree to maintain a sufficient amount of Digital Assets at all times to meet FTX\u2019s margin \nrequirements, as such requirements may be modified from time to time.  If the value of the \ncollateral in your Account falls below the maintenance margin requirement, FTX Trading may \nseize and liquidate any or all of your positions and assets to reduce your leverage.  If, after your \npositions and assets are liquidated, your Account still contains insufficient Digital Assets to \nrestore your margin ratio to the required amount, you will be responsible for any additional \nDigital Assets owed. \nFTX Trading may, in its sole discretion, perform measures to mitigate potential losses to you on \nyour behalf, including, but not limited to closing futures positions held in any Digital Asset or \nindex that FTX Trading plans to delist from the Exchange in accordance with Section 20. \nUnder certain market conditions, it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a position.  This can \noccur, for example, if there is insufficient liquidity in the market or due to technical issues on our \nplatform.  In the event that market conditions make it impossible to execute such orders, you \nmay be unable to limit your losses.  The use of leverage can lead to large losses as well as \ngains. \n7.\nLEVERAGED TOKENS \nLeveraged Tokens are \u201cERC-20\u201d digital tokens issued by FTX Trading that operate on the \nEthereum blockchain (\u201cLeveraged Tokens\u201d).  FTX offers Leveraged Tokens for each underlying \nDigital Asset or index (\u201cUnderlying\u201d).  Each Leveraged Token has an associated account on \nFTX that takes leveraged positions on perpetual futures contracts, and can be created or \nredeemed for its share of the Digital Assets of that account. \nUsers may create Leveraged Tokens by depositing Stablecoins and redeem Leveraged Tokens \nfor an equivalent amount of Stablecoins.  The Leveraged Token will automatically rebalance to \nadd or remove exposure based on the size of the creation or redemption.  Users are charged or \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-4    Filed 03/29/23    Page 5 of 20\n\ncredited an amount of Stablecoins equal to the number of Leveraged Tokens being created or \nredeemed multiplied by the Net Asset Value of the Leveraged Token as of the creation or \nredemption time.   \nLeveraged Tokens seek (but under no circumstances guarantee) daily results, before fees and \nexpenses, that correspond to 300% or 3x (\u201cBULL\u201d), -100% or -1x (\u201cHEDGE\u201d), or -300% or -3x \n(\u201cBEAR\u201d) of the daily return of the Underlying (in U.S. Dollars) for a single day, not for any other \nperiod.  A Leveraged Token\u2019s returns for a period longer than a single day will be the result of its \nreturn for each day, compounded over that period, and could differ in amount and direction from \nthe return of the Underlying over the same period. \nA Leveraged Token\u2019s returns may also deviate from expected returns in a period shorter than a \nsingle day for reasons including, but not limited to, scheduled or unscheduled rebalancing.  \nScheduled rebalancing occurs once daily in order to maintain the Leveraged Token\u2019s intended \nexposure to the market price of the Underlying.  Unscheduled rebalancing may occur, for \nexample, if the market price of the Underlying moves more than 10% in either direction within a \nsingle day in order to maintain the Leveraged Token\u2019s intended returns. \n8.\nFORKS AND DISTRIBUTIONS \nAs a result of the decentralized and open source nature of Digital Assets it is possible that \nsudden, unexpected, or controversial changes (\u201cForks\u201d) can be made to any Digital Asset that \nmay change the usability, functions, value or even name of a given Digital Asset.  Such Forks \nmay result in multiple versions of a Digital Asset and could lead to the dominance of one or \nmore such versions of a Digital Asset (each a \u201cDominant Digital Asset\u201d) and the partial or total \nabandonment or loss of value of any other versions of such Digital Asset (each a \u201cNon-\nDominant Digital Asset\u201d). \nFTX Trading is under no obligation to support a Fork of a Digital Asset that you hold in your \nAccount, whether or not any resulting version of such forked Digital Asset is a Dominant Digital \nAsset or Non-Dominant Digital Asset or holds value at or following such Fork.  Forks of Digital \nAssets can be frequent, contentious and unpredictable, and therefore cannot be consistently \nsupported on FTX.  When trading or holding Digital Assets using your Account, you should \noperate under the assumption that FTX will never support any Fork of such Digital Asset. \nIf FTX Trading elects, in its sole discretion, to support a Fork of a Digital Asset, it may choose to \ndo so by making a public announcement through its Site or otherwise notifying customers, and \nshall bear no liability for any real or potential losses that may result based on the decision to \nsupport such Fork or the timing of implementation of support.   If FTX Trading, in its sole \ndiscretion, does not elect to support a Fork of a given Digital Asset, including the determination \nto support, continue to support, or cease to support any Dominant Digital Asset or Non-\nDominant Digital Asset, FTX Trading assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any \nlosses or other issues that might arise from an unsupported Fork of a Digital Asset. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-4    Filed 03/29/23    Page 6 of 20\n\nFTX does not generally offer support for the distribution of assets based on a triggering fact or \nevent, such as the possession of another asset (each an \u201cAirdrop\u201d), the provision of rewards or \nother similar payment for participation in a Digital Asset\u2019s protocol (\u201cStaking Rewards\u201d), or any \nother distributions or dividends that Users might otherwise be entitled to claim based on their \nuse or possession of a Digital Asset outside of the FTX platform (collectively, \u201cDigital Asset \nDistributions\u201d).  FTX Trading may, in its sole discretion, elect to support any Digital Asset \nDistribution, but is under no obligation to do so and shall bear no liability to Users for failing to \ndo so, or for initiating and subsequently terminating such support. \nIn the event of a Fork of a Digital Asset, we may be forced to suspend all activities relating to \nsuch Digital Asset (including trades, deposits, and withdrawals) on FTX for an extended period \nof time, until FTX Trading has determined in its sole discretion that such functionality can be \nrestored (\u201cDowntime\u201d).  This Downtime may occur at the time that a Fork of a given Digital \nAsset occurs, potentially with little to no warning.  During such Downtime, you understand that \nyou may not be able to trade, deposit, or withdraw the Digital Asset subject to such Fork.  FTX \nTrading does not bear any liability for losses incurred during any Downtime due to the inability to \ntrade or otherwise transfer Digital Assets. \n9.\nATTACKS ON BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS \nFTX Trading cannot prevent or mitigate attacks on blockchain networks and has no obligation to \nengage in activity in relation to such attacks.  In the event of an attack, FTX Trading reserves \nthe right to take commercially reasonable actions, including, but not limited to, if we confirm that \na Digital Asset\u2019s network is compromised or under attack, immediately halting trading, deposits, \nand withdrawals for such Digital Asset.  If such an attack caused the Digital Asset to greatly \ndecrease in value, we may discontinue trading in such Digital Asset entirely. \nResolutions concerning deposits, withdrawals and User balances for a Digital Asset that has \nhad its network attacked will be determined on a case-by-case basis by FTX Trading in its sole \ndiscretion. FTX Trading makes no representation and does not warrant the safety of FTX and \nyou assume all liability for any lost value or stolen property. \n10. API USE \nSubject to your compliance with these Terms and any other agreement which may be in place \nbetween you and FTX Trading related to your use of the API, FTX Trading hereby grants you a \nlimited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license, to use the API \nsolely for the purposes of trading on FTX.  You agree to not use the API or data provided \nthrough the API for any other commercial purpose.  You access and use the API entirely at your \nown risk, and FTX Trading will not be responsible for any actions you take based on the API. \nFTX Trading may, at its sole discretion, set limits on the number of API calls that you can make, \nfor example, to maintain market stability and integrity.  You acknowledge and agree that if you \nexceed these limits, FTX Trading may moderate your activity or cease offering you access to \nthe API (or any other API offered by FTX Trading), each in its sole discretion.  FTX Trading may \nimmediately suspend or terminate your access to the API without notice if we believe you are in \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-4    Filed 03/29/23    Page 7 of 20\n\nviolation of these Terms or any other agreement which may be in place between you and FTX \nTrading related to your use of the API. \n11. ACCOUNT SUSPENSION AND CLOSURE \nFTX Trading may, in its sole and absolute discretion, without liability to you or any third party, \nrefuse to let you open an Account, suspend your Account, or terminate your Account or your use \nof one or more of the Services.  Such actions may be taken as a result of a number of factors, \nincluding without limitation account inactivity, failure to respond to customer support requests, \nfailure to positively identify you, a court order, or your violation of these Terms.  We may also \ntemporarily suspend access to your Account, in the event that a technical problem causes \nsystem outage or Account errors, until the problem is resolved. \nYou may terminate this agreement at any time by closing your Account in accordance with these \nTerms.  In order to do so, you should contact us for assistance in closing your Account.  You \nmay not close an Account if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such closure is being \nperformed in an effort to evade a legal or regulatory investigation or to avoid paying any \namounts otherwise due to FTX Trading. \nWe encourage you to withdraw any remaining balance of Digital Assets prior to issuing a \nrequest to close your Account.  We reserve the right to restrict or refuse to permit withdrawals \nfrom your Account if (i) your Account has otherwise been suspended or closed by us in \naccordance with these Terms; (ii) to do so would be prohibited by law or court order, or we have \ndetermined that the Digital Assets in you Account were obtained fraudulently; or (iii) you have \nnot completed the required identity verification procedure.  You can check whether or not your \nidentity has been verified by reviewing your verification status under the \u201cSettings\u201d section of \nyour Account.  Upon closure or suspension of your Account, you authorize FTX Trading to \ncancel or suspend pending transactions. \nIn the event that you or FTX Trading terminates this agreement or your access to the Services, \nor deactivates or closes your Account, you remain liable for all activity conducted with or in \nconnection with your Account while it was open and for all amounts due in connection with such \nactivity. \n12. RISK DISCLOSURES \nThe following risks associated with Digital Assets and the Services is not exhaustive. \nNo advice \nFTX Trading does not advise on the merits of any particular transactions, trading risks, or tax \nconsequences, and FTX Trading does not provide any other financial, investment, or legal \nadvice in connection with the Services.  To the extent that we or our representatives provide \ntrading recommendations, market commentary, or any other information, the act of doing so is \nincidental to your relationship with us and such information should not be construed as \ninvestment or financial advice.  Any decision to buy or sell Digital Assets is the User\u2019s decision \nand FTX Trading will not be liable for any loss suffered. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-4    Filed 03/29/23    Page 8 of 20\n\nYou accept the risk of trading Digital Assets.  In entering into any transaction on FTX, you \nrepresent that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your own \nindependent appraisal and investigations into the risks of the transaction and the underlying \nDigital Asset.  You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, \nprofessional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any \ntransaction or any underlying Digital Asset. \nDigital Asset transfers and volatility \nTrading in Digital Assets can be extremely risky and volatile.  Digital Assets may have unique \nfeatures that make them more or less likely to fluctuate in value.  Factors beyond FTX Trading\u2019s \ncontrol, such as regulatory activity, market manipulation, or unexplainable price volatility, may \naffect market liquidity for a particular Digital Asset.  Blockchain networks may go offline as a \nresult of bugs, Forks, or other unforeseeable reasons.  As a general matter, Users with limited \ntrading experience and low risk tolerance should not engage in active trading on FTX.  \nSpeculating on the value of Digital Assets is high risk and Users should never trade more than \nthey can afford to lose. \nUnderstanding Digital Assets requires advanced technical knowledge.  Digital Assets are often \ndescribed in exceedingly technical language that requires a comprehensive understanding of \napplied cryptography and computer code in order to appreciate the inherent risks.  The listing of \na Digital Asset on FTX does not indicate FTX Trading\u2019s approval or disapproval of the \nunderlying technology regarding any Digital Asset and should not be used as a substitute for \nyour own understanding of the risks specific to each Digital Asset.  We provide no warranty as \nto the suitability of the Digital Asset traded under these Terms and assume no fiduciary duty to \nUsers in connection with such use of the Services. \nUsers accept all consequences of sending Digital Assets to an address off the FTX platform.  \nDigital Asset transactions may not be reversible. Once you send Digital Assets to an address, \nyou accept the risk that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely.  For example, an \naddress may have been entered incorrectly and the true owner of the address may never be \ndiscovered, or an address may belong to an entity that will not return your Digital Assets, or may \nreturn your Digital Assets but first requires action on your part, such as verification of your \nidentity. \nFutures and leveraged products \nTrading of Futures Contracts and Leveraged Tokens may not be suitable for all Users and \nshould only be used by those who understand the consequences of seeking daily inverse or \nleveraged results. \nFutures Contracts involve margin and leverage, and as such, you may feel the effects of any \nlosses immediately.  If movements in the markets for a Futures Contract or the underlying \nDigital Asset decrease the value of your position in such Future Contract, you may be required \nto have or make additional collateral available as margin.  If your Account is under the minimum \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-4    Filed 03/29/23    Page 9 of 20\n\nmargin requirements set by the Exchange, your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you \nwill be liable for the deficit, if any, in your Account. \nUnlike Futures Contracts, Leveraged Tokens do not require Users to trade on margin.  However, \nthey remain subject to certain risks that you should understand before trading, including but not \nlimited to: \n\u25cf\nMarket Price Variance Risk: Holders buy and sell Leveraged Tokens in the secondary \nmarket at market prices, which may be different from the value of the underlying Digital \nAsset.  The market price for a Leveraged Token will fluctuate in response to changes in \nthe value of the token\u2019s holdings, supply and demand for the token and other market \nfactors. \n\u25cf\nInverse Correlation Risk: Holders of Leveraged Tokens that target an inverse return will \nlose money when the price of the Digital Asset rises, a result that is opposite from \nholding the underlying asset. \n\u25cf\nPortfolio Turnover Risk: Leveraged Tokens may incur high portfolio turnover to manage \nthe exposure to the underlying Digital Asset.  Additionally, active market trading of a \nLeveraged Token\u2019s holding may cause more frequent creation or redemption activities \nthat could, in certain circumstances, increase the number of portfolio transactions. High \nlevels of transactions increase transaction costs.  Each of these factors could have a \nnegative impact on the performance of a Leveraged Token. \n\u25cf\nInterest Rates: Leveraged Tokens take positions in futures contracts to achieve their \ndesired leverage.  These futures might trade at a premium or discount to spot markets in \nthe applicable Digital Asset as a reflection of prevailing interest rates in cryptocurrency \nmarkets.  Thus, a Leveraged Token could outperform or underperform the Digital Asset\u2019s \nreturns due to a divergence between the two markets. \nSupply and value of Digital Assets \nThe value of Digital Assets may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants \nto exchange Digital Assets for Digital Assets, which may result in the potential for permanent \nand total loss of value of a particular Digital Asset should the market for that Digital Asset \ndisappear. \nYou acknowledge and agree that Digital Assets and/or FTX features available in one jurisdiction \nmay not be available for trading or to access, as applicable, in another. \nBlacklisted addresses and forfeited funds \nLeveraged Tokens are Digital Assets built on the Ethereum blockchain.  FTX Trading reserves \nthe right to \u201cblacklist\u201d certain addresses and freeze associated Leveraged Tokens (temporarily \nor permanently) that it determines, in its sole discretion, are associated with illegal activity or \nactivity that otherwise violates these Terms (\u201cBlacklisted Addresses\u201d).  In the event that you \nsend Leveraged Tokens to a Blacklisted Address, or receive Leveraged Tokens from a \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-4    Filed 03/29/23    Page 10 of 20\n\nBlacklisted Address, FTX Trading may freeze such Leveraged Tokens and take steps to \nterminate your Account. \nIn certain circumstances, FTX Trading may deem it necessary to report such suspected illegal \nactivity to applicable law enforcement agencies and you may forfeit any rights associated with \nyour Leveraged Tokens, including the ability to redeem your Leveraged Tokens for U.S. Dollars.  \nFTX Trading may also be forced to freeze Leveraged Tokens in the event that we receive a legal \norder from a valid government authority requiring us to do so. \nSoftware protocols and operational challenges \nThe software protocols that underlie Digital Assets are typically open source projects, which \nmeans that (i) the development and control of such Digital Assets is outside of FTX\u2019s control and \n(ii) such software protocols are subject to sudden and dramatic changes that might have a \nsignificant impact on the availability, usability or value of a given Digital Asset. \nYou are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges.  FTX may experience \nsophisticated cyber attacks, unexpected surges in activity or other operational or technical \ndifficulties that may cause interruptions to the Services.  You understand that the Services may \nexperience operational issues that lead to delays. You agree to accept the risk of transaction \nfailure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting \nfrom sophisticated attacks.  You agree not to hold FTX Trading accountable for any related \nlosses. \nAll Users understand that the technology underlying Digital Assets is subject to change at any \ntime, and such changes may affect your assets stored on our platform.  You claim full \nresponsibility for monitoring such technological changes and understanding their consequences \nfor your Digital Assets.  Users conduct all trading on their own account and FTX Trading does \nnot take any responsibility for any loss or damage incurred as a result of your use of any \nServices or your failure to understand the risks involved associated with Digital Assets use \ngenerally or your use of our Services \nCompliance \nYou are responsible for complying with applicable law.  You agree that FTX is not responsible for \ndetermining whether or which laws may apply to your transactions, including but not limited to \ntax law.  You are solely responsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising from your use of \nthe Services. \nLegislative and regulatory changes \nLegislative and regulatory changes or actions at the domestic or international level may \nadversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Digital Assets. \nNo deposit protection \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-4    Filed 03/29/23    Page 11 of 20\n\nNeither Digital Assets nor any fiat currency held in your Account is eligible for any public or \nprivate deposit insurance protection. \nDigital Asset Distributions not supported \nCertain Digital Assets are built on protocols that support Digital Asset Distributions, including, \nbut not limited to, Forks, Staking Rewards and Airdrops (as defined in Section 8 above).  FTX \nTrading is not obligated to support any such Digital Asset Distributions for Users.  If you hold \nthese Digital Assets in your Account, you thereby forfeit the ability to claim any Digital Asset \nDistributions from FTX.  If you hold Digital Assets with proof-of-stake or delegated proof-of-stake \nconsensus algorithms, FTX Trading may in its sole discretion stake these Digital Assets without \nany obligation to distribute Staking Rewards to you.  Staking may subject your Digital Assets to \nadditional risks and FTX is not responsible for losses you may incur related to staking. \n13. RIGHT TO CHANGE OR REMOVE FEATURES AND SUSPEND OR DELAY \nTRANSACTIONS \nWe reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time \nand in any jurisdiction, including hours of operation or availability of any feature, without notice \nand without liability.  We may decline to process any order and may limit or suspend your use of \none or more Services at any time, in our sole discretion.  Suspension of your use of any of the \nServices will not affect your rights and obligations pursuant to these Terms. \nWe may, in our sole discretion, decline to process orders if (i) we believe the transaction is \nsuspicious; (ii) the transaction may involve fraud or misconduct; (iii) it violates applicable laws; \nor (vi) it violates these Terms.  Where permitted by law, we will notify you by the end of the \nbusiness day if we have suspended processing your orders and, if possible, provide our \nreasons for doing so and anything you can do to correct any errors leading to the stoppage. \n14. FEES \nIn consideration for the use of the Services, you agree to pay to FTX the appropriate fees, as \nset forth in our fee schedule displayed on the Site (\u201cFee Schedule\u201d), which FTX Trading may \nrevise or update in its sole discretion from time to time.  On request, FTX may make available \nan alternative fee schedule (\u201cAlternative Fee Schedule\u201d) to Users who satisfy certain criteria \n(such as in relation to trading volume), which are determined by FTX in its sole discretion from \ntime to time.  You authorize FTX to deduct any applicable fees from your Account at the time \nyou make a given transaction.  Changes to the Fee Schedule or Alternative Fee Schedule are \neffective as of the date set forth in any revision and will apply prospectively from that date \nforward. \n15.

ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT \nAPPLY TO YOU.  IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICES OR \nWITH THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE \nUSE OF THE SERVICES AND CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT.

GOVERNING LAW; VENUE AND ARBITRATION \nThe laws of Antigua and Barbuda shall govern these Terms.  Except as otherwise required by \nlocal law, any dispute between you and FTX Trading related in any way to, or arising in any way \nfrom, our Services or these Terms (\u201cDispute\u201d) shall be finally settled on an individual, non-\nrepresentative basis in binding arbitration in accordance with the Antigua and Barbuda \nArbitration Act (Cap 33), as modified by these Terms or in accordance with rules on which we \nmay mutually agree.  Any arbitration shall take place in Antigua and Barbuda.  The arbitrator \nmay award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys\u2019 fees \nwhen authorized by law. \n28. AMENDMENTS \nWe may amend any portion of these Terms at any time by posting the revised version of these \nTerms with an updated revision date.

THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS \nIf you grant express permission to a third party to connect to your Account, either through the \nthird party\u2019s product or through FTX, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party \nto take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under \nthis agreement.

UNCLAIMED OR ABANDONED PROPERTY \nIf FTX Trading is holding funds in your Account, and we are unable to contact you and have no \nrecord of your use of the Services for a prolonged period of time, applicable law may require us \nto report these funds as unclaimed property to the applicable jurisdiction.  If this occurs, FTX \nTrading will try to locate you at the address shown in our records, but if FTX Trading is unable to \nlocate you, we may be required to deliver any such funds to the applicable jurisdiction as \nunclaimed property.

FTX \nTrading does not act as principal or counterparty with respect to trades entered into on the \nPlatform. Notwithstanding the foregoing: \n(A) \nFTX Trading may act as a counterparty for limited trades made for the purpose of \nliquidating fees collected on User trades; and  \n(B) \nAffiliates of FTX Trading may execute trades on the Platform provided, however, that such \nAffiliates shall not be afforded any priority in trade execution. \nSave in certain limited circumstances set out in Section 38.13 (Exception to arbitration), Section \n38.12 (Arbitration) requires all Disputes to be resolved by way of legally binding arbitration on an \nindividual basis only and not as a claimant or class member in a purported class or representative \naction. There is no judge or jury in arbitration and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  \nThe laws of some jurisdictions may limit or not permit certain provisions of the Terms, such as \narbitration, indemnification, the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of certain liabilities. \nIn such a case, such provisions will apply only to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of \nsuch jurisdictions.  \nIn the Terms, unless the context otherwise requires, the definitions and rules of interpretation set \nout in Schedule 1 shall apply. \n1. \nSTRUCTURE OF TERMS  \n1.1 \nThe Terms comprise: \n1.1.1 \nthe general terms and conditions set out above, in Sections 1 (Structure of \nTerms) to 38 (General), and in Schedule 1 (Definitions and Interpretation), which \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 2 of 63\n\n      \n2 \napply generally to you, your registration and use of an Account, and your use of \nthe Services (\"General Terms\"); \n1.1.2 \nthe policies, schedules and other documents of FTX Trading and its Affiliates \nincorporated by reference into the Terms, including our Privacy Policy, Security \nPolicy and Fee Schedule (\"FTX Policies\"); and \n1.1.3 \nthe terms and conditions set out in each Service Schedule, which shall also apply \nto the Specified Service referred to therein. \n1.2 \nTo the extent there is any conflict or inconsistency between the modules of the Terms, \nsuch conflict or inconsistency shall be resolved in the following order of precedence, unless \na term or condition set out in a document of lower precedence is expressly identified as \ntaking precedence over a document of higher precedence: General Terms, Service \nSchedules, Fee Schedule, Privacy Policy, Security Policy and other FTX Policies. \n1.3 \nIMPORTANT: You acknowledge and agree that any Specified Service referred to in a \nService Schedule shall be provided to you by the Service Provider specified in that Service \nSchedule. In such case, the Specified Service shall be provided to you on and subject to \nthe Terms, with references in these General Terms to \"FTX Trading\" (or \"we\", \"our\" or \"us\") \nbeing read as references to the Service Provider specified in the Service Schedule, unless \nthe context provides otherwise, and under no circumstances shall any other person, \nincluding any Affiliate of the Service Provider, be liable to you for the performance of any of \nthe Service Provider's obligations under the Terms. \n2. \nRISK DISCLOSURES \nBefore beginning to use the Services, you should ensure you have read and understand \n(and you represent and warrant that you have read and understand) the following risk \ndisclosures and the risk disclosures set out in the Service Schedules. You should note that \nthis is not an exhaustive list of all of the risks associated with Digital Assets and the \nServices. \n2.1 \nNo advice and no reliance \n2.1.1 \nFTX Trading does not advise on the merits of any particular transaction, trading \nrisks, or tax consequences, and FTX Trading does not provide any other \nfinancial, investment, taxation or legal advice in connection with the Services. To \nthe extent that we or our representatives provide market commentary, or any \nother information, the act of doing so is incidental to your relationship with us and \nsuch information should not be construed as investment or financial advice. Any \ndecision by you to use the Services and transact in Digital Assets is your own \nindependent decision. You represent that you are not relying on any \ncommunication (written or oral) by us as investment advice or as a \nrecommendation to use the Services and transact in Digital Assets. FTX Trading \nwill not be liable for any loss suffered by you or any third party. \n2.1.2 \nYou accept the risk of trading Digital Assets. In entering into any transaction on \nthe Platform, you represent that you have been, are, and will be solely \nresponsible for making your own independent appraisal and investigations into \nthe risks of such transaction and the underlying Digital Asset. You represent that \nyou have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and \nexperience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction \nentered into on the Platform or any underlying Digital Asset. \n2.1.3 \nFTX Trading is not your broker, intermediary, agent, or advisor and has no \nfiduciary relationship or obligation to you in connection with any trades or other \ndecisions or activities effected by you using the Services. \n2.2 \nDigital Asset transfers and volatility \n2.2.1 \nTrading in Digital Assets can be extremely risky and volatile. Digital Assets may \nhave unique features that make them more or less likely to fluctuate in value. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 3 of 63\n\n      \n3 \nFactors beyond FTX Trading's control, such as regulatory activity or \nunexplainable price volatility, may affect market liquidity for a particular Digital \nAsset. Blockchain networks may go offline as a result of bugs, Forks (as defined \nin Section 17 below), or other unforeseeable reasons. As a general matter, you \nshould not engage in active trading on the Platform if you have limited trading \nexperience or low risk tolerance. Speculating on the value of Digital Assets is \nhigh risk and you should never trade more than you can afford to lose. \n2.2.2 \nUnderstanding Digital Assets requires advanced technical knowledge. Digital \nAssets are often described in exceedingly technical language that requires a \ncomprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer code in \norder to appreciate the inherent risks. The listing of a Digital Asset on the \nPlatform does not indicate FTX Trading's approval or disapproval of the \nunderlying technology of any Digital Asset and should not be used as a substitute \nfor your own understanding of the risks specific to each Digital Asset. We provide \nno warranty as to the suitability of the Digital Assets traded under the Terms and \nassume no fiduciary duty to you in connection with such use of the Services. \n2.2.3 \nYou accept all consequences of sending Digital Assets to an address off the \nPlatform. Digital Asset transactions may not be reversible. Once you send Digital \nAssets to an address, you accept the risk that you may lose access to your Digital \nAssets indefinitely. For example, an address may have been entered incorrectly \nand the true owner of the address may never be discovered, or an address may \nbelong to a person that will not return your Digital Assets or may return your \nDigital Assets but first require action on your part, such as verification of your \nidentity or compensation.  \n2.3 \nSupply and value of Digital Assets \n2.3.1 \nThe value of Digital Assets may be derived from the continued willingness of \nmarket participants to exchange Digital Assets for fiat currency and other Digital \nAssets, which may result in the permanent and total loss of value of a particular \nDigital Asset should the market for that Digital Asset disappear. \n2.3.2 \nYou acknowledge and agree that Digital Assets and/or Services (in whole or in \npart) available in one jurisdiction may not be available for trading, use or access, \nas applicable, in another. \n2.4 \nMargin trading \n2.4.1 \nMargin trading is HIGH RISK. As a borrower, you may sustain a total loss of \nDigital Assets, fiat currency and E-Money (as defined in Section 8.3.2 below \n(collectively, \"Assets\") in your Account, or owe Assets beyond what you have \ndeposited in your Account. When you lend Assets to other Users, you risk the \nloss of an unpaid principal if the borrower defaults on a loan and liquidation of the \nborrower\u2019s Account fails to raise sufficient Assets to cover the borrower\u2019s debt.  \n2.5 \nComplex products \n2.5.1 \nTrading of complex products, including but not limited to Futures Contracts, \nOptions Contracts, and MOVE Volatility Contracts (each as defined in the Service \nSchedules) (collectively, \"Complex Products\"), may not be suitable for all \nUsers. Complex Product trading is designed to be utilised only by sophisticated \nUsers, such as active traders employing dynamic strategies. You should use \nextreme caution when trading Complex Products and only trade them if you \nunderstand how they work, including but not limited to the risks associated with \nmargin trading, the use of leverage, the risk of shorting, and the effect of \ncompounding and market volatility risks on leveraged products. \n2.5.2 \nComplex Product trading entails significant risk, and you may feel the effects of \nlosses immediately. Complex Product trading requires initial posting of collateral \nto meet initial margin requirements. If movements in the markets for a Complex \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 4 of 63\n\n      \n4 \nProduct or the underlying Digital Asset decrease the value of your position in \nsuch Complex Product, you may be required to have or make additional collateral \navailable as margin to ensure that maintenance margin requirements are met. If \nyour Account is under the minimum margin requirements, your position may be \nliquidated at a loss, and you may lose all of your Assets in your Account. If there \nare any additional deficits in your Account, you will also be liable for all such \ndeficits. \n2.5.3 \nUSERS WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND LEVERAGE OR MARGIN TRADING, OR \nDO NOT INTEND TO ACTIVELY MANAGE THEIR PORTFOLIO, SHOULD NOT \nENGAGE IN COMPLEX PRODUCT TRADING. \n2.5.4 \nFTX TRADING AND ITS AFFILIATES DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY \nWHATSOEVER FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGE INCURRED AS A RESULT \nOF YOUR USE OF ANY COMPLEX PRODUCT TRADING SERVICES \nOFFERED ON THE PLATFORM OR YOUR FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND THE \nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLEX PRODUCT TRADING. \n2.6 \nBlacklisted addresses and forfeited Assets \n2.6.1 \nFTX Trading reserves the right to \"blacklist\" certain addresses and freeze \nassociated Assets (temporarily or permanently) that it determines, in its sole \ndiscretion, are associated with illegal activity or activity that otherwise violates the \nTerms (\"Blacklisted Addresses\"). In the event that you send Assets to a \nBlacklisted Address or receive Assets from a Blacklisted Address, FTX Trading \nmay freeze such Assets and take steps to terminate your Account. \n2.6.2 \nIn certain circumstances, FTX Trading may deem it necessary to report such \nsuspected illegal activity to applicable law enforcement agencies and other \nRegulatory Authorities, and you may forfeit any rights associated with your \nAssets, including the ability to redeem or exchange your Digital Assets for other \nDigital Assets or fiat currency. FTX Trading may also freeze Assets held in your \nAccount in the event that we receive a related order or request from a legal or \nRegulatory Authority. \n2.7 \nSoftware protocols and operational challenges \n2.7.1 \nThe software protocols that underlie Digital Assets are typically open source \nprojects or are otherwise operated by third parties, which means that: (i) the \noperations, functionalities, development and control of such Digital Assets and \ntheir underlying networks are outside of FTX Trading's control; and (ii) such \nsoftware protocols are subject to sudden and dramatic changes that might have a \nsignificant impact on the availability, usability or value of a given Digital Asset. \n2.7.2 \nYou are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges that may impact \nthe Services. The Platform may experience sophisticated cyber-attacks, \nunexpected surges in activity or other operational or technical difficulties that may \ncause interruptions to the Services. You understand that the Services may \nexperience operational issues that lead to delays. You agree to accept the risk of \ntransaction failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, \nincluding those resulting from sophisticated attacks. You agree not to hold FTX \nTrading liable for any related losses. \n2.7.3 \nYou understand that the technology underlying Digital Assets is subject to change \nat any time, and such changes may affect your Digital Assets stored on the \nPlatform. You are fully responsible for monitoring such technological changes and \nunderstanding their consequences for your Digital Assets.  \n2.7.4 \nUsers conduct all trading on their own account and FTX Trading does not take \nany responsibility for any loss or damage incurred as a result of your use of any \nServices or your failure to understand the risks associated with Digital Assets use \ngenerally or your use of our Services. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 5 of 63\n\n      \n5 \n2.7.5 \nDigital Assets depend on the availability and reliability of power, connectivity, and \nhardware.  Interruption or failure of any of these things may disrupt the networks \non which the Digital Assets rely or your ability to access or transact in Digital \nAssets. \n2.8 \nCompliance \nYou are responsible for complying with all Applicable Laws. You agree that FTX Trading is \nnot responsible for determining whether or which laws and regulations may apply to your \ntransactions, including but not limited to tax laws and regulations. You are solely \nresponsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising from your use of the Services. \n2.9 \nLegislative and regulatory changes \nLegislative and regulatory changes or actions at the domestic or international level may \nadversely affect the use, transfer, ability to transact in, and value of Digital Assets, or your \naccess to, and our ability to provide, the Services. You acknowledge and accept the risks \nthat such changes may bring and that FTX Trading is not liable for any adverse impact that \nthat you may suffer as a result. \n2.10 \nNo deposit protection \nNeither Digital Assets nor any fiat currency or E-Money held in your Account is eligible for \nany public or private deposit insurance protection. \n2.11 \nDigital Asset Distributions not supported \nCertain Digital Assets are built on protocols that support Digital Asset Distributions (as \ndefined in Section 17.4 below), including, but not limited to, Forks (as defined in Section \n17.1 below), Staking Rewards (as defined in Section 17.4 below) and Airdrops (as defined \nin Section 17.4 below). FTX Trading is not obligated to support any such Digital Asset \nDistributions for Users. If you hold these Digital Assets in your Account, you thereby forfeit \nthe ability to claim any Digital Asset Distributions from FTX Trading. If you hold Digital \nAssets with proof-of-stake or delegated proof-of-stake consensus algorithms, FTX Trading \nmay in its sole discretion stake these Digital Assets without any obligation to distribute \nStaking Rewards to you. Staking may subject your Digital Assets to additional risks and \nFTX Trading is not liable for losses you may incur related to staking. \n2.12 \nReliance on third parties \nYour use of the Services and the value of certain Digital Assets may rely on the acts of \nthird parties or the fulfilment of related obligations by third parties. FTX Trading is not \nresponsible for the acts or omissions of such third parties. \n3. \nAPPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS \n3.1 \nCompliance with Applicable Laws \n3.1.1 \nYou agree and understand that by opening an Account and using the Services in \nany capacity, you shall act in compliance with all Applicable Laws. Failure to do \nso may result in the suspension of your ability to use the Services or the closure \nof your Account. \n3.1.2 \nWithout limitation to the above, your access to and use of your Account and the \nServices, and the receipt of any fee discounts and rebates, is subject to your \ncontinued compliance with all Applicable Laws, including the rules and directions \nof any applicable Regulatory Authority and, without limitation, all applicable tax, \nanti-money laundering (\"AML\") and counter-terrorist financing (\"CTF\") laws and \nregulations. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 6 of 63\n\n      \n6 \n3.2 \nAML and CTF procedures \nOur AML and CTF procedures are guided by all applicable rules and regulations regarding \nAML and CTF.

In such circumstances, you authorise us to debit the relevant \namount of fiat currency using your selected payment method(s) to complete your \npurchase. \n8.2.3 \nThe Platform enables you to exchange one Digital Asset for another Digital Asset, \nsend Digital Assets to and receive Digital Assets from other Users of the \nServices, or third parties outside of the Platform (where permitted by FTX Trading \nin its sole discretion).  \n8.2.4 \nYou may sell Digital Assets in exchange for certain supported fiat currencies \n(depending on your location).

As the owner of Digital Assets in your Account, \nyou shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Assets.

At any time, subject \nto outages, downtime, and other applicable policies (including the \nTerms), you may withdraw your Digital Assets by sending them to a \ndifferent blockchain address controlled by you or a third party. \n8.2.7 \nFTX Trading is under no obligation to issue any replacement Digital Asset in the \nevent that any Digital Asset, password or private key is lost, stolen, \nmalfunctioning, destroyed or otherwise inaccessible. \n8.2.8 \nIt is your responsibility to ensure that you send all Digital Assets, to the correct \naddress provided for that particular Digital Asset, including with respect to any \nDigital Assets that you send to the Platform. If you send a Digital Asset to an \naddress that does not correspond to that exact Digital Asset (such as an address \nnot associated with your Account or the specific Digital Asset sent), such Digital \nAsset may be lost forever. By sending any Digital Assets to the Platform, you \nattest that you will only send a supported Digital Asset to the Platform wallet \naddress provided to you. For example, if you select an Ethereum Platform wallet \naddress to receive funds, you attest that you are initiating an inbound transfer of \nEthereum alone, and not any other forms of Digital Assets. You agree that FTX \nTrading incurs no obligation whatsoever with regards to sending unsupported \nDigital Assets to an address provided to you on the Platform.

You are solely liable for verifying the accuracy of any \nexternal wallet address, and the identity of the recipient. All outbound transfers of \nDigital Assets cannot be reversed once they are broadcast to the underlying \nblockchain network. FTX Trading does not control any blockchain network and \ncannot guarantee that any transfer will be confirmed or transferred successfully \nby the network. FTX Trading is not responsible for any losses or for taking any \nactions to attempt to recover any lost, stolen, misdirected or irrecoverable Digital \nAssets. If the Digital Assets are recoverable, we may in our sole discretion \nattempt to recover them, but such recovery efforts are in no way guaranteed. \nPlease be aware that if you attempt to deposit ETH to your Account by sending it \nvia a smart contract, your ETH may not be automatically credited, and may take \ntime to recover, and may not be recovered at all. \n8.2.10 \nWhen you elect to transfer Digital Assets from your Account to a third party wallet \naddress or other location, it is always possible that the party administering the \nnew location may reject your transfer or that the transfer may fail due to technical \nor other issues affecting the Platform. You agree that you shall not hold FTX \nTrading liable for any damages arising from a rejected or failed transfer. \n8.2.11 \nYou hereby represent and warrant to us that any Digital Assets used by you in \nconnection with the Services (including any Digital Assets used to fund your \nAccount) are either owned by you or that you are validly authorised to carry out \ntransactions using such Digital Assets, and that all transactions initiated with your \nAccount are for your own Account and not on behalf of any other person. \n8.2.12 \nIt is your responsibility entirely to provide us with correct details of any withdrawal \naddress. We accept no liability resulting in you or any third party not receiving \nDigital Assets withdrawn by you due to you providing incorrect, erroneous, \nincompatible or out-of-date details. \n8.3 \nFiat currency \n8.3.1 \nWhere specified on the Site or in a Service Schedule, and depending on your \nlocation, the Platform may support various fiat currencies for deposit, withdrawal, \nand/or trading, using wire transfers, credit cards, or other appropriate methods.  \n8.3.2 \nOnce we receive fiat currency that you load into your Account, we may issue you \nwith an equivalent amount of electronic money (\"E-Money\"), denominated in the \nrelevant fiat currency, which represents the fiat currency that you have loaded. \nThis amount will be displayed in your Account.  \n8.3.3 \nE-MONEY IS NOT LEGAL TENDER. FTX TRADING IS NOT A DEPOSITORY \nINSTITUTION AND YOUR E-MONEY IS NOT A DEPOSIT OR INVESTMENT \nACCOUNT. YOUR E-MONEY ACCOUNT IS NOT INSURED BY ANY PUBLIC \nOR PRIVATE DEPOSIT INSURANCE AGENCY. \n8.3.4 \nE-Money held in your Account will not earn any interest. Your Account may hold \nE-Money denominated in different currencies and we will show the E-Money \nbalance for each currency that you hold.  \n8.3.5 \nYou may purchase Digital Assets by using E-Money credited to your Account \n(depending on your location). To carry out a Digital Asset purchase using E-\nMoney, you must follow the relevant instructions on the Site. You authorise us to \ndebit E-Money from your Account to complete your purchase. Although we will \nattempt to deliver Digital Assets to you as promptly as possible, E-Money may be \ndebited from your Account before Digital Assets are delivered to your Account. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 12 of 63\n\n      \n12 \n8.3.6 \nYou may sell Digital Assets in exchange for certain fiat currencies (depending on \nyour location). To carry out a Digital Asset sale, you must follow the relevant \ninstructions on the Site. You authorise us to debit Digital Assets from your \nAccount and send instructions to credit your Account with the relevant amount of \nfiat currency. Once we receive the fiat currency, we will issue you with an \nequivalent amount of E-Money denominated in the relevant fiat currency.  \n8.3.7 \nYou may redeem all or part of any E-Money held in your Account at any time \nsubject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies (including the Terms), \nby selecting the relevant option in the Site and following the instructions. Unless \nagreed otherwise, funds will be transferred to the bank account you have \nregistered with us. You hereby represent and warrant that this bank account is \nyour own, and that you have full control over it. It is your responsibility entirely to \nprovide us with correct details of your withdrawal account. We accept no liability \nresulting in you not receiving any amounts withdrawn by you due to you providing \nincorrect or out-of-date details. \n8.3.8 \nIf the Terms are terminated, we may redeem any E-Money remaining in your \nAccount and attempt to transfer the equivalent amount of fiat currency to the bank \naccount you have registered with us. Prior to redeeming E-Money from your \nAccount, we may conduct checks for the purposes of preventing fraud, money \nlaundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes, and as required by \nApplicable Law. This may mean you are prevented or delayed from withdrawing \nE-Money until those checks are completed to our reasonable satisfaction in order \nto comply with our regulatory requirements. \n9. \nUNCLAIMED OR ABANDONED PROPERTY \n9.1 \nIf FTX Trading is holding Assets in your Account (\"Unclaimed or Abandoned Property\"), \nand we are unable to contact you and have no record of your use of the Services for a \nprolonged period of time or your Account has been closed, Applicable Laws may require us \nto report such Unclaimed or Abandoned Property as unclaimed property to the applicable \njurisdiction. If this occurs, FTX Trading will try to locate you using the details shown in our \nrecords in relation to your Account, but if FTX Trading is unable to locate you, we may be \nrequired to deliver any such Unclaimed or Abandoned Property to the applicable \njurisdiction as unclaimed property. FTX Trading reserves the right to deduct a dormancy \nfee or other administrative charges from such Unclaimed or Abandoned Property, as \npermitted by Applicable Laws.  \n9.2 \nIf FTX Trading is holding Unclaimed or Abandoned Property, and we are unable to contact \nyou and have no record of your use of the Services for a prolonged period of time or your \nAccount has been closed, and Applicable Laws do not require us to report such Unclaimed \nor Abandoned Property as unclaimed property to the applicable jurisdiction, then you \nacknowledge and agree that your Account may be transferred to FTX Trading, or an \nAffiliate of FTX Trading, as Trustee of the Unclaimed or Abandoned Property. FTX Trading \nor the Affiliate of FTX Trading (as applicable), as Trustee, will hold the Unclaimed or \nAbandoned Property on your behalf and shall, on demand, repay to you the Unclaimed or \nAbandoned Property subject to your payment of any dormancy fee or other administrative \ncharges that the Trustee may deduct from the Unclaimed or Abandoned Property. If no \nsuch demand is made by you, the Trustee may pay the Unclaimed or Abandoned Property \ninto court in the applicable jurisdiction in accordance with Applicable Laws.   \n9.3 \nIf we receive legal documentation confirming your death or other information leading us to \nbelieve you have died, we will freeze your Account and during this time, no transactions \nmay be completed until: your designated fiduciary has opened a new Account, as further \ndescribed below, and the entirety of your Account has been transferred to such new \naccount, or (ii) we have received proof in a form satisfactory to us that you have not died. If \nwe have reason to believe you may have died but we do not have proof of your death in a \nform satisfactory to us, you authorise us to make enquiries, whether directly or through \nthird parties, that we consider necessary to ascertain whether you have died. Upon receipt \nby us of proof satisfactory to us that you have died, the fiduciary you have designated in a \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 13 of 63\n\n      \n13 \nvalid will or similar testamentary document will be required to open a new Account. If you \nhave not designated a fiduciary, then we reserve the right to treat as your fiduciary any \nperson entitled to inherit your Account, as determined by us upon receipt and review of the \ndocumentation we, in our sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary or appropriate, \nincluding (but not limited to) a will, a living trust or other similar documentation, or (ii) \nrequire an order designating a fiduciary from a court having competent jurisdiction over \nyour estate. In the event we determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that there is \nuncertainty regarding the validity of the fiduciary designation, we reserve the right to \nrequire an order resolving such issue from a court of competent jurisdiction before taking \nany action relating to your Account. Pursuant to the above, the opening of a new Account \nby a designated fiduciary is mandatory following the death of an Account owner, and you \nhereby agree that your fiduciary will be required to open a new Account in order to gain \naccess to the contents of your Account. \n10. \nDEBIT ACCOUNT BALANCE \n10.1 \nIf at any time your Account has a debit balance, you agree to pay us: (i) the applicable fees \nset out in the Fee Schedule; (ii) the total debit balance; and (iii) such other amounts \nspecified in the Terms. \n10.2 \nIf you fail to pay such amounts, we may suspend your ability to use the Services or close \nyour Account. We also reserve the right to debit your Account accordingly and/or to \nwithhold amounts from fiat currency and Digital Assets that you may transfer to your \nAccount. \n10.3 \nIf, after a demand is made by FTX Trading, you have not made payment of the outstanding \ndebit balance by the time stated in the demand, then: \n10.3.1 \nyou authorise us to sell any Digital Assets or redeem any fiat currency or E-\nMoney in your Account to recover the outstanding debit balance;  \n10.3.2 \nyou agree to indemnify us and each other Indemnified Party against all Losses \nthat we suffer or incur as a result of your not paying the outstanding debit \nbalance; and \n10.3.3 \nyou will be liable for all costs which we incur in relation to instructing a collection \nagency, law firm or other third party to assist with and advise on the collection of \nsuch outstanding debit balance (where applicable). \n11. \nTHIRD PARTY PERMISSIONS TO CONNECT TO OR ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT \nIf you grant express permission to a third party to connect to your Account, either through \nthe third party's product or through the Platform, you acknowledge that granting permission \nto a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your \nresponsibilities under the Terms. Further, you acknowledge and agree that you will not hold \nFTX Trading responsible for, and will indemnify FTX Trading from, any liability arising from \nthe actions or inactions of such third party in connection with the permissions you grant. \n12. \nACCOUNT SUSPENSION AND CLOSURE; SERVICE SUSPENSION AND \nTERMINATION \n12.1 \nFTX Trading may, in its sole and absolute discretion and at any time, without liability to you \nor any third party: \n12.1.1 \nrefuse to let you open an Account, suspend your Account, or terminate your \nAccount; \n12.1.2 \ndecline to process any instruction or Order submitted by you; and/or \n12.1.3 \nlimit, suspend or terminate your use of one or more, or part of, the Services. \n12.2 \nSuch actions will not relieve you from your obligations pursuant to the Terms. \n12.3 \nSuch actions may be taken as a result of a number of factors, including without limitation: \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 14 of 63\n\n      \n14 \n12.3.1 \nas a result of account inactivity, your failure to respond to customer support \nrequests, our failure or inability to positively identify you; \n12.3.2 \nas a result of a court order or your violation of Applicable Laws or the Terms; or \n12.3.3 \nwhere we believe that a transaction is suspicious or may involve fraud, money \nlaundering, terrorist financing or other misconduct. \n12.4 \nIf you do not agree with any actions taken by us under Section 12.1, then your sole and \nexclusive remedy is to terminate your use of the Services and close your Account. You \nagree that neither we nor any other Indemnified Party shall be liable to you or any third \nparty for any Losses suffered as a result of any actions taken by us under Section 12.1. \n12.5 \nWithout limitation to the foregoing, we may temporarily suspend access to your Account in \nthe event that a technical problem causes a system outage or Account errors until the \nproblem is resolved. \n12.6 \nWhere required by Applicable Laws, we will notify you promptly if we have suspended \nprocessing your Orders or Convert Instructions and, if possible, provide our reasons for \ndoing so and anything you can do to correct or remedy the matters giving rise to such \nsuspension. \n12.7 \nYou may close your Account or terminate your access to and use of the Services at any \ntime upon request to FTX Trading, in accordance with the Terms. In order to close your \nAccount or terminate your access to and use of the Services, you should contact us for \nassistance. You may not close an Account if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such \nclosure is being performed in an effort to evade a legal or regulatory investigation or to \navoid paying any amounts otherwise due to FTX Trading or its Affiliates.  \n12.8 \nWe encourage you to withdraw any remaining balance of Assets prior to issuing a request \nto close your Account. We reserve the right to restrict or refuse to permit withdrawals from \nyour Account if: \n12.8.1 \nyour Account has otherwise been suspended or closed by us in accordance with \nthe Terms;  \n12.8.2 \nto do so would be prohibited by Applicable Laws or court order, or we have \ndetermined that the Assets in your Account were obtained fraudulently; or  \n12.8.3 \nyou have not completed the required identity verification procedure. You can \ncheck whether or not your identity has been verified by reviewing your verification \nstatus under the \"Settings\" section of your Account.  \n12.9 \nUpon closure or suspension of your Account, you authorise FTX Trading to cancel or \nsuspend pending transactions. \n12.10 Notwithstanding that you or FTX Trading closes or deactivates your Account or terminates \nor suspends your access to and use of any Services, or the termination or expiry of the \nTerms, you shall remain liable for all activity conducted with or in connection with your \nAccount while it was open, and for all amounts due in connection with such activity.  \n13. \nRESTRICTED ACTIVITIES \nIn connection with your use of the Services, you agree that you will not: \n13.1.1 \nviolate or assist any party in violating any Applicable Laws or any rule of any self-\nregulatory or similar organisation of which you are or are required to be a \nmember through your use of the Services; \n13.1.2 \nprovide false, inaccurate, incomplete, out-of-date or misleading information; \n13.1.3 \ninfringe upon FTX Trading's or any third party's copyrights, patents, trademarks, \nor other intellectual property rights; \n13.1.4 \nengage in any illegal activity, including without limitation illegal gambling, money \nlaundering, fraud, blackmail, extortion, ransoming data, the financing of terrorism, \nother violent activities or any prohibited market practices; \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 15 of 63\n\n      \n15 \n13.1.5 \ndistribute unsolicited or unauthorised advertising or promotional material, written \nmedia releases, public announcements and public disclosures, junk mail, spam or \nchain letters; \n13.1.6 \nuse a web crawler or similar technique to access our Services or to extract data; \n13.1.7 \nreverse engineer or disassemble any aspect of the Site, the API, or the Services \nin an effort to access any source code, underlying ideas and concepts and \nalgorithms; \n13.1.8 \nperform any unauthorised vulnerability, penetration or similar testing on the API \nor Services; \n13.1.9 \ntake any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on \nour infrastructure, or detrimentally interfere with, intercept, or expropriate any \nsystem, data or information; \n13.1.10 transmit or upload any material to the Site that contains viruses, Trojan horses, \nworms, or any other harmful or deleterious programs; \n13.1.11 otherwise attempt to gain unauthorised access to or use of the Site, the API, \nother FTX Accounts, computer systems, or networks connected to the Site, \nthrough password mining or any other means; \n13.1.12 transfer any rights granted to you under the Terms; \n13.1.13 engage in any activity which, in our reasonable opinion, amounts to or may \namount to market abuse including without limitation the carrying out of fictitious \ntransactions or wash trades, front running or engaging in disorderly market \nconduct; \n13.1.14 engage in any behaviour which is unlawful, violates the Terms, or is otherwise \ndeemed unacceptable by FTX Trading in its sole discretion; or \n13.1.15 assist, facilitate or encourage any third party in undertaking any activity otherwise \nprohibited by the Terms. \n14. \nELECTRONIC TRADING TERMS \n14.1 \nFTX Trading may, in its sole discretion, choose to discontinue support for a currently listed \nor supported Digital Asset at any time, including without limitation where there are changes \nin the characteristics of such Digital Asset. \n14.2 \nA transaction on the Platform may fail for several reasons including, without limitation, as a \nresult of a change in prices, insufficient margin, or unanticipated technical difficulties. FTX \nTrading makes no representation or warranty that any transaction will be executed \nproperly. Under no circumstances are we liable for any loss or injury suffered by a failure of \na transaction to complete properly or in a timely manner. Further, we are in no way \nresponsible for notifying you of a transaction failure, although you are able to see any such \nfailures via your Account. You have full responsibility for determining and inquiring into the \nfailure of any transaction which you initiate. \n14.3 \nIn the event that you receive any data, information, or software through our Services other \nthan that which you are entitled to receive pursuant to the Terms, you will immediately \nnotify us and will not use, in any way whatsoever, such data, information or software. If you \nrequest a withdrawal of Digital Assets and we cannot comply with it without closing some \npart of your open positions, we will not comply with the request until you have closed \nsufficient positions to allow you to make the withdrawal. \n14.4 \nWe may refuse to execute a trade or impose trade amount limits or restrictions at any time, \nin our sole discretion without notice. Specifically, we reserve the right to refuse to process, \nand the right to cancel or reverse, any transaction, as well as to revoke access to a User's \ndeposit address on the Platform, where we suspect the transaction involves money \nlaundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of crime or if we suspect the \ntransaction relates to a prohibited use as stated in the Terms. FTX Trading reserves the \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 16 of 63\n\n      \n16 \nright to halt deposit activity at our sole discretion. A User may not change, withdraw, or \ncancel its authorisation to make a transaction, except with respect to partially filled Orders. \n14.5 \nFTX Trading may correct, reverse, or cancel any trade impacted by an error in processing \na User's transaction or otherwise. The User's remedy in the event of an error will be limited \nto seeking to cancel an Order or Convert Instruction or obtaining a refund of any amounts \ncharged to the User. FTX Trading cannot guarantee such cancellations or refunds will \nalways be possible. \n14.6 \nOrders placed on the Order Book may be partially filled or may be filled by one or more \nOrders placed on the Order Book by other Users, depending on the trading activity on the \nOrder Book at the time an Order is placed.  \n14.7 \nThe Digital Assets available for purchase through the Platform may be subject to high or \nlow transaction volume, liquidity, and volatility at any time for potentially extended periods. \nYou acknowledge that while FTX Trading uses commercially reasonable methods to \nprovide Exchange Rate information to you through the Platform, the Exchange Rate \ninformation we provide may differ from prevailing exchange rates made available by third \nparties. Similarly, the actual market rate at the time of your trade may be different from the \nindicated Exchange Rate. You agree that you assume all risks and potential losses \nassociated with price fluctuations or differences in any actual versus indicated Exchange \nRates. \n15. \nSTAKING \n15.1 \nWhen you hold Digital Assets on the Platform you may be given the option to \"stake\" these \nassets via staking services provided by FTX Trading or its Affiliates. You are not required \nto stake any Digital Assets and you can opt out of any staking services (subject to \napplicable early withdrawal limits or penalties as specified on the staking page for such \nDigital Asset). If you stake your Digital Assets, FTX Trading or its Affiliate will facilitate the \nstaking of such Digital Assets on your behalf. You agree and acknowledge that you have \nno right to any staking rewards whatsoever. FTX TRADING DOES NOT GUARANTEE \nTHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE ANY STAKING REWARDS OVER TIME, INCLUDING THE \nDISPLAYED STAKING REWARDS RATES. \n15.2 \nThe tax treatment of staking Digital Assets is uncertain, and it is your responsibility to \ndetermine what taxes, if any, arise from the transactions. You are solely responsible for \nreporting and paying any applicable taxes arising from staking services and all related \ntransactions, and acknowledge that FTX Trading does not provide investment, legal, or tax \nadvice to you in connection with such election to participate. You should conduct your own \ndue diligence and consult your advisors before making any investment decision including \nwhether to participate in staking and related transactions. \n16. \nMARGIN TRADING \n16.1 \nThis Section 16 applies only to the extent you are permitted to engage in margin trading on \nthe Platform. Margin trading is prohibited in certain jurisdictions, and you may not be able \nto engage in margin trading on the Platform. We reserve the right to amend and/or remove \nmargin trading functionality at any time. \n16.2 \nMargin trading is HIGH RISK. As a borrower, you may sustain a total loss of Assets or owe \nAssets beyond what you have deposited to your Account. The high volatility and \nsubstantial risk of illiquidity in markets means that you may not always be able to liquidate \nyour position. You agree to maintain a sufficient amount of Assets at all times to meet our \nmargin requirements, as such requirements may be modified from time to time. If the value \nof the Assets in your Account falls below the margin maintenance requirement or we \ndetermine, in our sole discretion, that your Account appears to be in danger of defaulting \non a loan, we may seize and/or liquidate any or all of your positions and Assets on any \nbalance in your Account in order to reduce your leverage or settle your debt to other Users, \nin which case, you may sustain a total loss of all Assets in your Account. Our liquidation \nmechanism is described at https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027668712-\nLiquidations. If, after your positions and Assets are liquidated, your Account still contains \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 17 of 63\n\n      \n17 \ninsufficient Assets to settle your debts to other Users, you will be responsible for any \nadditional Assets owed. Intentionally defaulting on a loan may result in our reporting your \nactivities to authorities and/or in legal prosecution. \n16.3 \nWhen you lend Assets to other Users, you risk the loss of an unpaid principal if the \nborrower defaults on a loan and liquidation of the borrower\u2019s Account fails to raise sufficient \nAssets to cover the borrower\u2019s debt. Although we take precautions to prevent borrowing \nUsers from defaulting on loans, the high volatility and substantial risk of illiquidity in \nmarkets means that we cannot make any guarantees to any Users using the Services \nagainst default.  \n16.4 \nUnder certain market conditions, it may become difficult or impossible to liquidate a \nposition. This can occur, for example, if there is insufficient liquidity in the market or due to \ntechnical issues on the Platform. Placing contingent Orders, such as \"stop-loss\" or \"stop-\nlimit\" Orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market \nconditions may make it impossible to execute such Orders. In such an event, our backstop \nliquidity provider program may come into play, but there is no assurance or guarantee that \nany such program activities will be sufficient or effective in liquidating your position. As a \nresult, you may lose all of your Assets or incur a negative balance in your Account. In \naddition, even if you have not suffered any liquidations or losses, your Account balance \nmay be subject to clawback due to losses suffered by other Users. \n16.5 \nThe use of leverage can work against you as well as for you and can lead to large losses \nas well as gains. Users conduct all trading, margin trading, lending, and/or borrowing on \ntheir own account and we do not take any responsibility for any loss or damage incurred as \na result of your use of any Services or your failure to understand the risks associated with \nmargin trading on the Platform. \n17. \nFORKS AND DISTRIBUTIONS \n17.1 \nAs a result of the decentralised and open source nature of Digital Assets it is possible that \nsudden, unexpected, controversial or other changes (\"Forks\") can be made to any Digital \nAsset that may change the usability, functions, compatibility, value or even name of a given \nDigital Asset. Such Forks may result in multiple versions of a Digital Asset and could lead \nto the dominance of one or more such versions of a Digital Asset (each a \"Dominant \nDigital Asset\") and the partial or total abandonment or loss of value of any other versions \nof such Digital Asset (each a \"Non-Dominant Digital Asset\"). \n17.2 \nFTX Trading is under no obligation to support a Fork of a Digital Asset that you hold in your \nAccount, whether or not any resulting version of such forked Digital Asset is a Dominant \nDigital Asset or Non-Dominant Digital Asset or holds value at or following such Fork. Forks \nof Digital Assets can be frequent, contentious and unpredictable, and therefore cannot be \nconsistently supported on the Platform. When trading or holding Digital Assets using your \nAccount, you should operate under the assumption that the Platform will never support any \nFork of such Digital Asset. \n17.3 \nIf FTX Trading elects, in its sole discretion, to support a Fork of a Digital Asset, it may \nchoose to do so by making a public announcement through its Site or otherwise notifying \ncustomers and shall bear no liability for any real or potential losses that may result based \non the decision to support such Fork or the timing of implementation of support. If FTX \nTrading, in its sole discretion, does not elect to support a Fork of a given Digital Asset, \nincluding the determination to support, continue to support, or cease to support any \nDominant Digital Asset or Non-Dominant Digital Asset, FTX Trading assumes no \nresponsibility or liability whatsoever for any losses or other issues that might arise from an \nunsupported Fork of a Digital Asset. \n17.4 \nThe Platform does not generally offer support for the distribution of Digital Assets based on \na triggering fact or event, such as the possession of another Digital Asset (each an \n\"Airdrop\"), the provision of rewards or other similar payment for participation in a Digital \nAsset's protocol (\"Staking Rewards\"), or any other distributions or dividends that Users \nmight otherwise be entitled to claim based on their use or possession of a Digital Asset \noutside of the Platform (collectively, \"Digital Asset Distributions\"). FTX Trading may, in \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 18 of 63\n\n      \n18 \nits sole discretion, elect to support any Digital Asset Distribution, but is under no obligation \nto do so and shall bear no liability to Users for failing to do so, or for initiating and \nsubsequently terminating such support. \n17.5 \nIn the event of a Fork of a Digital Asset, we may be forced to suspend all activities relating \nto such Digital Asset (including trades, deposits, and withdrawals) on the Platform for an \nextended period of time, until FTX Trading has determined in its sole discretion that such \nfunctionality can be restored (\"Downtime\"). This Downtime may occur at the time that a \nFork of a given Digital Asset occurs, potentially with little to no warning. During such \nDowntime, you understand that you may not be able to trade, deposit, or withdraw the \nDigital Asset subject to such Fork. FTX Trading does not bear any liability for losses \nincurred during any Downtime due to the inability to trade or otherwise transfer Digital \nAssets. \n18. \nATTACKS ON BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS \n18.1 \nFTX Trading cannot prevent or mitigate attacks on blockchain networks and has no \nobligation to engage in activity in relation to such attacks. In the event of an attack, FTX \nTrading reserves the right to take (or to not take) actions, including, but not limited to, \nimmediately halting trading, deposits and withdrawals for a Digital Asset if we believe that \nthe Digital Asset's network is compromised or under attack. If such an attack caused the \nDigital Asset to greatly decrease in value, we may discontinue trading in such Digital Asset \nentirely. \n18.2 \nResolutions concerning deposits, withdrawals and User balances for a Digital Asset that \nhas had its network attacked will be determined on a case-by-case basis by FTX Trading in \nits sole discretion. FTX Trading makes no representation and does not warrant the safety \nof the Services and you assume all liability for any lost value or stolen property. \n19. \nSITE; THIRD PARTY CONTENT \n19.1 \nFTX Trading strives to provide accurate and reliable information and content on the Site, \nbut such information may not always be correct, complete, or up to date. You should \nalways carry out your own independent appraisal and investigations in relation to such \ninformation and not rely on it in any way.  \n19.2 \nThe Site may also contain links to third party websites, applications, events or other \nmaterials (\"Third Party Content\"). Such information is provided for your convenience and \nlinks or references to Third Party Content do not constitute an endorsement by FTX \nTrading of any products or services. FTX Trading makes no representation as to the \nquality, suitability, functionality or legality of Third Party Content, or to any goods and \nservices available from third party websites, and FTX Trading shall have no liability for any \nlosses incurred as a result of actions taken in reliance on the information contained on the \nSite or in any Third Party Content. \n19.3 \nWe have no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other \naspect of any goods or services that you may purchase from a third party (including other \nUsers of the Platform). We are not responsible for ensuring that a third party buyer or seller \nyou transact with will complete the transaction or is authorised to do so. If you experience a \nproblem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party purchased \nusing Digital Assets in connection with the Services, you must resolve the dispute directly \nwith that third party. \n20. \nAVAILABILITY \n20.1 \nWe do not represent that you will be able to access your Account or the Services 100% of \nthe time. Your Account and the Services are made available to you without warranty of any \nkind, either express or implied. There are no guarantees that access will not be interrupted, \nor that there will be no delays, failures, errors, omissions or loss of transmitted information. \nThis could result in the inability to trade on the Platform for a period of time and may also \nlead to time delays. We may, from time to time, suspend access to your Account and the \nServices, for both scheduled and emergency maintenance. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 19 of 63\n\n      \n19 \n20.2 \nYou acknowledge and agree that neither FTX Trading nor any other Indemnified Party shall \nhave any liability to you or any third party for the correctness, quality, accuracy, security, \ncompleteness, reliability, performance, timeliness, pricing or continued availability of the \nServices or for delays or omissions of the Services, or for the failure of any connection or \ncommunication service to provide or maintain your access to the Services, or for any \ninterruption in or disruption of your access or any erroneous communications between FTX \nTrading (or any other Indemnified Party) and you, regardless of cause. \n20.3 \nFTX Trading may determine not to make the Services, in whole or in part, available in \nevery market, either in its sole discretion or due to legal or regulatory requirements. In \naddition, FTX Trading may determine not to make the Services, in whole or in part, \navailable to you, depending on your location. If you travel to a Restricted Territory, our \nServices may not be available and your access to our Services may be blocked. You \nacknowledge that this may impact your ability to trade on the Platform and/or monitor any \nexisting Orders or open positions or otherwise use the Services. You must not attempt in \nany way to circumvent any such restriction, including by use of any virtual private network \nto modify your internet protocol address. \n21. \nRIGHT TO CHANGE, SUSPEND OR DISCONTINUE SERVICES  \n21.1 \nWe reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any \ntime and in any jurisdiction, including hours of operation or availability of any feature, \nwithout notice and without liability. We may advise you of any such changes, suspensions \nor discontinuations via your Account or the other contact details that you have provided to \nus but shall have no obligation to do so. \n21.2 \nIf you do not agree with any change, suspension, or discontinuance of any aspect of the \nServices, then your sole and exclusive remedy is to terminate your use of the Services and \nclose your Account. You agree that neither we nor any other Indemnified Party shall be \nliable to you or any third party for any Losses suffered as a result of any such changes, \nsuspensions, discontinuations or decisions. \n22. \nUPDATES TO THE TERMS \n22.1 \nWe reserve the right to amend any part of the Terms, at any time, by posting the revised \nversion of the Terms on the Site, with an updated revision date. The changes will become \neffective, and shall be deemed accepted by you, the first time you use the Services after \nthe initial posting of the revised Terms and shall apply on a going-forward basis with \nrespect to transactions initiated after the posting date.

Quarterly Futures \nContracts expire to a time-weighted average price (\"TWAP\") of their \nassociated index on the last Friday of every quarter between 2am and \n3am UTC. If you hold an expiring position, you will be credited with USD \nprofit and loss equal to the expiration price shortly after. \nPerpetual Futures Contracts represent obligations to buy or sell a Digital \nAsset at a specific price, at any time while the contract remains open. \nPerpetual Futures Contracts do not have an expiry date but instead, \ncontinuously roll over, i.e. every hour, each perpetual futures contract has \na funding payment where longs pay shorts equal to 1 hour TWAP of \nPremium / 24. \nYou can trade Futures Contracts on the Futures Market by posting \ncollateral in the form of fiat currency (depending on your jurisdiction) and \nDigital Assets to cover initial and maintenance margin. \nInstead of delivery of the underlying Digital Asset, your profit or loss is \nsettled in stablecoins. \nIMPORTANT: Section 16 of the General Terms applies to this service. \nFutures Contracts are Complex Products and the trading of Futures \nContracts is high risk. The market price of any Futures Contract may not \nreflect the price of spot markets in the applicable underlying Digital Assets \nand may fluctuate significantly in response to the value of the underlying \nDigital Asset\u2019s(s') price, supply and demand, and other market factors. \nIn order to trade Futures Contracts on the Futures Market, you must post \ncollateral. Depending on market movements, your positions may be \nliquidated, and you may sustain a total loss of the Assets in your Account. \nThis is because Futures Contract trading can be highly leveraged, with a \nrelatively small amount of funds used to establish a position in a Digital \nAsset or index having a much greater value. For instance, a small price \ndecrease on a 20x leveraged Futures Contact\u2019s underlying Digital Asset \ncould result in 20x loss in your leveraged position in the Futures Contract. \nFurther, short positions will lose money when the price of the underlying \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 36 of 63\n\n      \n36 \nDigital Asset rises, a result that is opposite from holding the underlying \nDigital Asset.  \nYOU AGREE AND HEREBY AUTHORISE THE SERVICE PROVIDER \nAND ITS AFFILIATES TO TAKE ANY MEASURES IN THEIR SOLE \nDISCRETION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FORCED POSITION \nREDUCTION AND LIQUIDATION UNDER MARKET VOLATILITY, \nILLIQUIDITY AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR THE PURPOSES \nOF MITIGATING POTENTIAL LOSSES TO YOU, OTHER USERS, AND \nTHE SERVICE PROVIDER AND ITS AFFILIATES. \nBy trading in Futures Contracts on the Futures Market on the Platform, \nyou acknowledge and agree that you have sufficient investment \nknowledge, financial expertise, and experience and the capacity to take \non the increased risks arising from Futures Contract trading.

If the market \nprice is lower, the option expires to USD 0.00. In the case of Put Options, \nthe reverse applies. \nYou can trade Options Contracts on the Volatility Market by posting \ncollateral in fiat currency (depending on your location) and Digital Assets, \nto cover initial and maintenance margin. \nInstead of delivery of the underlying Digital Asset on the specified expiry \ndate, your profit or loss is settled in stablecoins. \nIMPORTANT: Section 16 of the General Terms applies to this service. \nThe Options Contracts on the Volatility Market are European style. This \nmeans that you will not be able to exercise the option before the specified \nexpiry date. \nThe Options Contracts auto-expire, which means that the Service \nProvider will automatically exercise all options \"in the money\" and no \noptions \"out of the money\". \nThe Options Contracts expire on their specified expiry date at 3:00:00AM \nUTC. The expiration price of the underlying Digital Asset is based on a 1-\nhour TWAP of the underlying index the hour before expiration. \nOptions Contracts are Complex Products and the trading of Options \nContracts is high risk.

Each Leveraged Token has an associated \naccount on the Platform that takes leveraged positions on Perpetual \nFutures Contracts on an underlying Digital Asset or Digital Asset index \n(collectively \"Underlying\") and can be created or redeemed for its share \nof the Digital Assets of that account. \nLeveraged Tokens seek (but under no circumstances guarantee) daily \nresults, before fees and expenses, that correspond to 300% or 3x \n(\"BULL\"), -100% or -1x (\"HEDGE\"), or -300% or -3x (\"BEAR\") of the daily \nreturn of the Underlying (in U.S. Dollars) for a single day, not for any other \nperiod. A Leveraged Token's returns for a period longer than a single day \nwill be the result of its return for each day, compounded over that period, \nand could differ in amount and direction from the return of the Underlying \nover the same period. \nA Leveraged Token's returns may also deviate from expected returns in a \nperiod shorter than a single day for reasons including, but not limited to, \nscheduled or unscheduled rebalancing. Scheduled rebalancing occurs \nonce daily in order to maintain the Leveraged Token's intended exposure \nto the market price of the Underlying. Unscheduled rebalancing may \noccur, for example, if the market price of the Underlying moves more than \n10% in either direction within a single day in order to maintain the \nLeveraged Token's intended returns. \nLeverage Tokens are Complex Products, and the trading of Leveraged \nTokens is high risk.

The market price for a Leveraged Token \nwill fluctuate in response to changes in the value of the Leveraged \nToken\u2019s holdings, supply and demand for the Leveraged Token and \nother market factors. \n\u2022 \nInverse correlation risk: Holders of Leveraged Tokens that target an \ninverse return will lose money when the price of the Underlying rises, \na result that is opposite from holding the Underlying. \n\u2022 \nPortfolio turnover risk: Leveraged Tokens may incur high portfolio \nturnover to manage the exposure to the Underlying. Additionally, \nactive market trading of a Leveraged Token\u2019s holding may cause \nmore frequent creation or redemption activities that could, in certain \ncircumstances, increase the number of portfolio transactions. High \nlevels of transactions increase transaction costs. Each of these \nfactors could have a negative impact on the performance of a \nLeveraged Token. \n\u2022 \nInterest rates: Leveraged Tokens take positions in Perpetual Futures \nContracts to achieve their desired leverage. These Perpetual Futures \nContracts might trade at a premium or discount to spot markets in the \napplicable Underlying as a reflection of prevailing interest rates in \ncryptocurrency markets. Thus, a Leveraged Token could outperform \nor underperform the Underlying\u2019s spot market returns due to a \ndivergence between the two markets. \n \n \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 43 of 63\n\n      \n43 \nSCHEDULE 9 \nSERVICE SCHEDULE \n \nSpecified Service \nVolatility Market (BVOL/iBVOL Tokens) \nSpecified Service \ndescription \nThe Volatility Market is a trading platform on which you can trade BVOL \nTokens and iBVOL Tokens (collectively, BVOL/iBVOL Tokens) with \nother Users, with or without leverage. \nService Provider \nThis Specified Service forms part of the Services and is provided by FTX \nTrading Ltd, a company incorporated and registered in Antigua and \nBarbuda (company number 17180), to all eligible Users other than \npersons who have their registered office or place of residence in the \nUnited States of America or any Restricted Territory. \nSpecified Service \nspecific terms (in \naddition to the \nGeneral Terms) \nBVOL/iBVOL Tokens are \"ERC-20\" digital tokens issued by LT Baskets \nLtd, an Affiliate of FTX Trading. Each BVOL/iBVOL Token has an \nassociated account on the Platform that holds MOVE Volatility Contracts \nand Perpetual Futures Contracts on BTC (collectively, \"Underlying\"), in \nan attempt to track the implied percent-based volatility of BTC. In \nparticular, BVOL Tokens attempt to track the daily returns of being 1x \nlong the implied volatility of BTC and iBVOL Tokens attempt to track the \ndaily returns of being 1x short the implied volatility of BTC. \nIn order to get their volatility exposure, BVOL Tokens trade MOVE \nVolatility Contracts and Perpetual Futures on BTC. In particular, they aim \nto hold 1/6th each of each MOVE Volatility Contract that has not yet had \nits strike price determined as of each rebalance. That means 1/6th each \nof: \n\u2022 \nTomorrow's MOVE Volatility contract \n\u2022 \nNext weeks' MOVE contract, and the two weeks after that \n\u2022 \nNext Quarter's MOVE contract, and the quarter after that \nand \n\u2022 \n-1x BTC-PERP (Short)  \nIBVOL, conversely, aims to hold -1/6th each of those MOVE Volatility \ncontracts and 1x Perpetual Futures Contract on BTC (Long). \nBVOL targets +1x leverage, and IBVOL targets -1x leverage. As such, \nBVOL should not need to significantly alter its leverage at rebalance time \n(00:02:00 UTC every day): there may be small amounts of slippage but by \nand large its leverage should always be 1. IBVOL, however, will need to. \nIf volatility is down, iBVOL will have gains and will reinvest them by selling \nmore MOVE contracts; if volatility is up, iBVOL will have losses and will \nbuy back MOVE contracts to reduce risk and attempt to avoid liquidation. \nBecause of this BVOL almost completely avoids liquidation risk, but \nIBVOL is at risk if volatility doubles in a day. To mitigate this, iBVOL also \nhas daily rebalances. If market moves cause iBVOL's leverage to reach -\n4/3, it will do an intraday rebalance to reduce risk.   \nYOU AGREE AND HEREBY AUTHORISE THE SERVICE PROVIDER \nAND ITS AFFILIATES TO TAKE ANY MEASURES IN THEIR SOLE \nDISCRETION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FORCED POSITION \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 44 of 63\n\n      \n44 \nREDUCTION AND LIQUIDATION UNDER MARKET VOLATILITY, \nILLIQUIDITY AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR THE PURPOSES \nOF MITIGATING POTENTIAL LOSSES TO YOU, OTHER USERS, AND \nTHE PLATFORM. \nBVOL/iBVOL Tokens are Complex Products and the trading of \nBVOL/iBVOL Tokens is high risk.

As a Lender, you can select \u201cLEND\u201d on the P2P \nCrypto Loans website or participate in the FTX Earn program on the Mobile Application, and specify \nthe amount, minimum rate and type of crypto asset that you wish to lend out in order to become \neligible to lend out your crypto assets. Your lending offer will then be submitted to FTX Trading\u2019s P2P \nCrypto Loan order book and automatically matched with borrowers, if any.  \nThe amount of funds borrowed, funding rates and estimated funding rates are based solely on \nhistorical data, are not guaranteed and are subject to frequent change on an hourly basis. There is \nno assurance that you will be able to lend out your crypto assets, that there will be any borrowers \navailable to you, that there will be any demand for crypto borrowing, or that any of the displayed \nlending rates are accurate. FTX Trading reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the \nordering and matching of Lenders and Borrowers. You further agree to pay any platform charges or \nfees that FTX Trading may provide from time to time.  \nYou are not required to lend out any assets at any time. To stop lending out your assets, (a) go to \nthe P2P Crypto Loans website and click on \u201cSTOP LENDING\u201d at any time, or (b) if you are \nparticipating in the FTX Earn program on the Mobile Application, click on \u201cDisable\u201d in \u201cProfile\u201d \uf0e0 \n\u201cEarn rewards on assets\u201d. \nAll loans of crypto assets via the P2P Crypto Loans website are non-recourse loans. You agree that \nyour sole recourse in the event of default of a Borrower\u2019s P2P Crypto Loan is the seizure and/or \nliquidation of assets held in the Borrower\u2019s Account. You agree, and shall cause all of your agents, \nrepresentatives and affiliates to agree, not to seek recourse or recompense against any funds, assets \nor properties owned by a Borrower outside of the Borrower\u2019s Account at any time.  \nLENDING CRYPTO ASSETS VIA P2P CRYPTO LOANS IS VERY HIGH RISK AND ARE NOT \nINSURED IN ANY WAY BY FTX TRADING, ANY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY, OR ANY THIRD \nPARTY. AS A LENDER, YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF YOUR LENT CRYPTO ASSETS \nIF THE BORROWER DEFAULTS ON A P2P CRYPTO LOAN AND SEIZURE AND/OR \nLIQUIDATION OF THE BORROWER\u2019S ACCOUNT FAIL TO REPAY SUFFICIENT CRYPTO \nASSETS TO COVER THE BORROWER\u2019S DEBT TO YOU OR OTHER LENDERS.  \nBorrowing \nTo become a P2P Crypto Loan borrower (\u201cBorrower\u201d), you must have first deposited crypto assets \nwith FTX Japan into your Account as collateral. As a borrower, you can select \u201cEnable Peer to Peer \nborrowing\u201d on the P2P Crypto Loans website to enable borrowing of crypto assets from other FTX \nJapan users. The amount of crypto assets that you are entitled to borrow from time to time is \ndetermined based on a number of factors, including the amount of crypto assets made available by \nlenders for borrowing, the amount of crypto assets available in your Account as collateral, crypto \nasset market liquidity and volatility conditions, national, regional and global economic conditions, \nlegal and regulatory requirements, as well as other factors that FTX Trading may consider from time \nto time.  \nAll borrowed crypto assets using the P2P Crypto Loans website are non-recourse with respect to \nany assets held by the Borrower in the Borrower\u2019s Account. In other words, in the event of default, \nneither FTX Trading, any Lenders, nor any of their affiliates, agents or representatives may seek \nrecourse or recompense against any funds, assets or properties owned by a Borrower outside of the \nBorrower\u2019s Account. In the event of default of a Borrower\u2019s P2P Crypto Loan, the sole recourse of \nany Lender is the seizure and/or liquidation of assets held in the Borrower\u2019s Account. \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-5    Filed 03/29/23    Page 58 of 63\n\n      \n58 \nYou agree to pay (a) any interest charges that may accrue on your P2P Crypto Loan, which you may \nview on the P2P Crypto Loans website, and (b) any platform charges or fees that FTX Trading may \nprovide from time to time, which will be viewable on the P2P Crypto Loans website as well. \nYou are not required to borrow any crypto assets at any time. By enabling P2P Crypto Loan \nborrowing, you agree to do so at your own risk. You acknowledge and agree that any crypto assets \nborrowed from a Lender via a P2P Crypto Loan may be used for any purposes on the FTX Japan \ntrading platform, including for trading, collateral and withdrawals, provided however, that you agree \nthat FTX Trading may instruct FTX Japan to limit withdrawals of crypto assets borrowed under P2P \nCrypto Loans in the event that there is insufficient assets in your Account. \nBORROWING P2P CRYPTO LOANS ON FTX TRADING IS VERY HIGH RISK. AS A BORROWER, \nYOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF CRYPTO ASSETS IN YOUR ACCOUNT. THE HIGH \nVOLATILITY AND SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF ILLIQUIDITY IN THE MARKETS MEANS THAT YOU \nMAY NOT BE ABLE TO LIQUIDATE YOUR ACCOUNT ASSETS IN TIME, OR AT ALL. IF THE \nVALUE OF THE ASSETS HELD IN YOUR ACCOUNT FALLS BELOW THE MINIMUM BALANCE \nREQUIREMENT OR FTX TRADING DETERMINES IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION THAT YOUR \nACCOUNT APPEARS TO BE IN DANGER OF DEFAULTING ON A P2P CRYPTO LOAN, FTX \nTRADING OR THE APPLICABLE LENDER(S) MAY, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, SEIZE AND \nLIQUIDATE ANY OR ALL OF YOUR POSITIONS AND ASSETS IN YOUR ACCOUNT TO REPAY \nYOUR

The Application addresses several legal issues that are \nessential to identifying the creditors, assets and beneficiaries of FTX Digital.  These are exactly \nthe types of matters that the JPLs and the Chapter 11 Debtors agreed could be litigated in The \nBahamas.  The Cooperation Agreement expressly states that it does not \u201caddress or compromise \nany rights or obligations of any Party arising out of or related to the user agreements or other \narrangements relating to the International Platform\u201d.  Cooperation Agreement \u00b6 10. \nEnclosed with this letter is a draft of the Application that the JPLs intend to issue in the Supreme \nCourt.  The requirement for the JPLs to seek directions in the Application has become urgent. Until \nthe JPLs have some certainty as to who their customers are, the governing law of various \nagreements and the effect of such agreements, its provisional liquidation cannot progress.  This is \ncrucially important because there are various parties who withdrew sums from FTX Digital in the \ndays immediately before the commencement of the provisional liquidation.  The JPLs need \nconfirmation that FTX Digital has standing to claw back those payments and needs to take action \nquickly.  Moreover, a determination of the aggregate amount and nature of creditor claims that \nmay be properly asserted against FTX Digital is critical to the progression of the liquidation \nprocess in The Bahamas, and to the JPLs\u2019 ability to make reasoned and well-informed business \ndecisions related thereto.   \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-6    Filed 03/29/23    Page 2 of 8\n\nSullivan & Cromwell \nMarch 9, 2023 \n \n2 \nAMERICAS 120255696 v6 \n1901733-0002 \n \n \n \n \nThe JPLs are eager to get these issues resolved as soon as possible and therefore intend to file the \nApplication by March 14, 2023. \nSincerely, \nBrian Pfeiffer \nE bpfeiffer@whitecase.com  \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-6    Filed 03/29/23    Page 3 of 8\n\nCOMMONWEALTH OF THE BAHAMAS \n \n \n \n \n \n2022 \n \nIN THE SUPREME COURT \n \n \n \n \n \n    \nCOM/com/ \n \nCOMMERCIAL DIVISION \n \n \n \nIN THE MATTER OF the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges Act, 2020 \n(as amended) \n \nAND IN THE MATTER OF the Companies (Winding Up Amendment) Act, 2011 \n \n \nAND IN THE MATTER OF FTX DIGITAL MARKETS LTD.  \n(A Registered Digital Asset Business)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDraft/ SUMMONS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLET ALL PARTIES concerned attend before  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \na Judge of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, in Chambers at the \nSupreme Court of The Bahamas, Annex 1, Nassau, The Bahamas on  \n \n \n \n \nthe  \n \n day of   \n \n \nA.D., 2023 at   \no\u2019clock in the   \n-noon \nor as soon thereafter as Counsel can be heard on an application on behalf of the Joint Provisional \nLiquidators (the \u201cJPLs\u201d) of FTX Digital Markets Ltd (\u201cFTX DM\u201d) pursuant to the Companies \n(Winding Up Amendment) Act 2011, section 199(4) and the Companies Liquidation \nRules 2012,  O.4, r.5(2), and Supreme Court Act, section 15 and/or under the inherent \njurisdiction of the Court for binding directions and declarations as to the following matters: \n \n \n1.

(\u201cFTX DM\u201d) \nDear Brian: \nI have your letter of March 9 on behalf of the JPLs for FTX DM about \ncommencing litigation in The Bahamas for \u201cbinding directions and declarations\u201d on a list \nof very central topics to the proceedings in front of Judge Dorsey.  At a minimum, this is \nexactly the sort of action that the Cooperation Agreement contemplated would first be \nhandled by meet and confer, which I think the Cooperation Agreement and respect for the \nDelaware proceedings both require.  As we have told you in the past, Mr. Ray and the \nFTX Debtors believe that all of the matters mentioned in the two-page \u201cApplication\" \nattached to your letter\u2014as well as a list of related other questions not raised\u2014must be \naddressed in front of Judge Dorsey in Delaware to have any practical effect.  These \nmatters concern what is and is not property of the chapter 11 estates of the FTX Debtors \nin the United States bankruptcy proceeding, and also relate to assets that are subject to \nforfeiture to the United States in connection with the prosecution of the founders in \nUnited States criminal proceedings.  They require a full adversary proceeding in \nDelaware and the involvement of all applicable parties in interest, including the Official \nCommittee of Creditors, the various ad hoc committees of customers, the Australian JPLs \nand yourselves.  We were clear in the Cooperation Agreement, that there could be no \ndeference to Bahamian proceedings on FTX matters in which non-Bahamian stakeholders \nhave an interest, especially in light of the history of why the founders went to The \nBahamas in the first place and the harm they caused to non-Bahamians while there. \nThe FTX Debtors and many of the stakeholders with whom we consult \nalso are concerned with statements by the JPLs publicly and to third parties and \ngovernment officials outside of The Bahamas that are uncoordinated and inconsistent \nwith the positions of the FTX Debtors, and in many cases appear to be intentionally \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-7    Filed 03/29/23    Page 2 of 3\n\n \n \nBrian Pfeiffer \n \n-2- \n \n \nmisleading.  The Cooperation Agreement was not intended to condone interference by \nthe JPLs with the Chapter 11 cases, almost the entirety of which involves non-Bahamian \ncreditors, non-Bahamian assets and non-Bahamian recipients of avoidable transfers. \nRather than file papers to start a local legal process we have not discussed \nto resolve issues we have not discussed, we would like to offer a meet and confer next \nweek at the convenience of yourself and the clients.  When we last spoke we were \nplanning that.  The FTX Debtors have their own papers to file in front of Judge Dorsey \nand can do so if we must, but please let me know if you will agree to wait to file litigation \npapers until we can have that discussion and see if there is any common ground from at \nleast a process perspective. \nSincerely, \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAndy Dietderich \ncc: \nKris Hansen \nKenneth Pasquale  \n(Paul Hastings) \n \nSophia T.

(\u201cFTX Digital\u201d) \nDraft Application  \nDear Andy: \nWe write in response to your letter of March 11.  \nAs our letter of March 9 made clear, the Application to be filed in the Supreme Court of The \nBahamas (the \u201cBahamas Court\u201d) addresses matters of concern to the provisional liquidation of \nFTX Digital that is taking place in The Bahamas, not the U.S. Without the resolution of those \nmatters by the Bahamas Court, which is the court with control and supervision of the provisional \nliquidation of FTX Digital and the JPLs, the restructuring and/or winding up of the FTX Digital \nestate cannot progress.  \nThese matters concern FTX Digital and are not, as you assert, \u201cin front of\u201d Judge Dorsey. They \nfall squarely within the jurisdiction of the Bahamas Court in relation to a Bahamas-incorporated \ncompany in provisional liquidation in The Bahamas. The Application raises issues under the laws \nof the Bahamas, Antigua & Barbuda and England (not U.S.). The Application concerns \nstakeholders in FTX Digital\u2019s insolvency in The Bahamas, not those of the Debtors in their chapter \n11 cases. The JPLs are entitled to look to their own Court, with substantial experience of the routine \napplication of the applicable laws, to determine issues that concern the provisional liquidation \nunder the supervision of that Court.  \nThe Application does not, as you suggest, interfere with the Debtors\u2019 chapter 11 cases. Just as the \nDebtors would not ask the Bahamas Court to determine issues of U.S. law relating to their estates \nin Chapter 11, the JPLs are not required to ask the US court to determine issues integral to the FTX \nDigital estate.  \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-8    Filed 03/29/23    Page 2 of 4\n\nSullivan & Cromwell \nMarch 13, 2023 \n \n2 \nAMERICAS 120518815 v5 \n1901733-0002 \n \n \n \n \nWhile there may be similar issues that arise in the chapter 11 case of FTX Trading Ltd. and that \nDebtor may desire a \u201cfull adversary proceeding in Delaware\u201d, that is a matter for FTX Trading \nLtd. whose main proceedings are in Delaware.  FTX Digital cannot be forced to have matters that \nconcern its estate to be determined by a foreign U.S. court in a proceeding that concerns the \nseparate estate of FTX Trading Ltd.  \n \nIt is with some disappointment that, despite having repeatedly explained to you the features of \nFTX Digital\u2019s provisional liquidation in The Bahamas, you continue to either misunderstand or \nignore them. A provisional liquidation under the law of The Bahamas encompasses all \nstakeholders with a claim against FTX Digital wherever situated.  The insolvency law of The \nBahamas entitles \u201cnon-Bahamian stakeholders\u201d full equality with Bahamian stakeholders in \nrelation to their rights and interests. Your suggestion, therefore, that non-Bahamian stakeholders \nof FTX Digital will, in some way, be discriminated against or prejudiced by the Application is \nentirely wrong.  \n \nAs to your assertion that the Application in some way violates the Cooperation Agreement, this is \nalso not true. When negotiating the Agreement the parties were abundantly aware that these issues \nwere not intended to be encompassed by it.  As set forth in our March 9 letter, the text of the \nCooperation Agreement also makes this point clear. \n \nRegrettably, while the JPLs have lived up to their obligations under the Cooperation Agreement, \nthe Debtors have not.  Specifically: \n \n\uf0b7 Clause 4(b): despite agreement that FTX Digital is to be responsible for recovering value \nfrom the Tether assets in The Bahamas, the Debtors contacted Tether\u2019s counsel, Michael \nHilliard, and claimed that those assets belong to the Debtors and not FTX Digital. This has \nhad the predictable and obvious consequence that Tether has refused to release the assets \ninto the control of the JPLs as agreed in the Cooperation Agreement. \n\uf0b7 Clause 15: the Cooperation Agreement is clear that the value in properties owned by \nPropco would be realized by a liquidation proceeding opened in The Bahamas. Despite this \nfact, the Debtors have refused to cooperate with the JPLs\u2019 efforts to begin this process.  As \na result, Propco\u2019s assets in the Bahamas are devoid of management, and risk dissipation \nand depreciation in value. \n\uf0b7 Clause 22: having agreed to share information, the Debtors have failed to make available \nto the JPLs Whatsapp, slack, emails and other messages passing between employees of \nFTX Digital and others. These communications are critical to fully understanding the \nparameters of FTX Digital\u2019s estate. During our meetings on the Cooperation Agreement \nthe Debtors expressly agreed to provide these communications, but now the Debtors have \ninexplicitly reversed their position to do so on the basis of privilege. The privilege in \ncommunications by employees FTX Digital is clearly the privilege of FTX Digital and not \nthe Debtors. Even if joint privilege exists with respect to certain documents the parties \nentered into an NDA to cover these exact situations.  \n\uf0b7 Clause 9:  the Cooperation Agreement also makes clear that the parties shall consult \nreasonably and in good faith about any action relating to proceedings for asset recovery \nCase 22-11068-JTD    Doc 1194-8    Filed 03/29/23    Page 3 of 4\n\nSullivan & Cromwell \nMarch 13, 2023 \n \n3 \nAMERICAS 120518815 v5 \n1901733-0002 \n \n \n \n \nfunctions relating to the International Platform.  Despite this and knowing the JPLs\u2019 \nposition that such recovery actions seek the return of FTX Digital customer funds, the \nDebtors have not consulted with us on a single action that has been taken in the Chapter 11 \nCases for recovery of assets, including:  \no Alameda Adversary Proceeding Case No. 23-50084 (Delaware Bankruptcy Court) \no Voyager Stipulation  [Dkt. 769] \no Greyscale Lawsuit Case No. 23-0276 (Delaware Chancery Court) \n \nWith respect to your vague, unspecified and unsubstantiated claim that the JPLs have made public \nstatements and statements to third parties or public officials outside of The Bahamas that are \nsomehow false or misleading, we refute this baseless allegation.  All of the JPLs\u2019 statements have \nbeen true and correct.  While it is certainly true that the JPLs may have views that differ from those \nof the Debtors that does not make them false.  This is not the first time that the Debtors have made \nunsubstantiated and false statements about the JPLs, the Bahamian Court and The Bahamas. \n \nWith respect to your suggestion that we meet with you concerning the Application, we have made \nrepeated requests over the past month to meet with the Debtors. We remain willing to meet in the \nhope that the Debtors will live up to the Cooperation Agreement and seek to work with the JPLs \nin moving matters forward.  We propose to set up a zoom conference on Wednesday, March 15, \n2023 at 3:00 p.m. EST.  \n \nWhile the JPLs are also happy to discuss the Application with you, the JPLs will not change their \nview that the Application should be issued in and resolved by the Bahamas Court. Given the \npositions taken in your letter, and in order to avoid doing anything that could even considerably \ngive you any argument that we are violating the automatic stay, the JPLs are immediately asking \nthe Bahamian Court for authority to file a motion asking Judge Dorsey for an order confirming \nthat the automatic stay does not apply to the Application or, in the alternative, modifying the stay \nto allow for the Application to be litigated in The Bahamas.
